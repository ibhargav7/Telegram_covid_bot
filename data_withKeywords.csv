2,2,What happens to the people who get COVID-19?,"Among those who develop symptoms, most (about 80%) recover from the disease without needing hospital treatment. About 15% become seriously ill and require oxygen and 5% become critically ill and need intensive care.
Complications leading to death may include respiratory failure, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), sepsis and septic shock, thromboembolism, and/or multiorgan failure, including injury of the heart, liver or kidneys.
In rare situations, children can develop a severe inflammatory syndrome a few weeks after infection.

4,4,"Are there long-term effects of COVID-19?
","Some people who have had COVID-19, whether they have needed hospitalization or not, continue to experience symptoms, including fatigue, respiratory and neurological symptoms.
WHO is working with our Global Technical Network for Clinical Management of COVID-19, researchers and patient groups around the world to design and carry out studies of patients beyond the initial acute course of illness to understand the proportion of patients who have long term effects, how long they persist, and why they occur.  These studies will be used to develop further guidance for patient care.

6,6,"When should I get a test for COVID-19?
","Anyone with symptoms should be tested, wherever possible. People who do not have symptoms but have had close contact with someone who is, or may be, infected may also consider testing – contact your local health guidelines and follow their guidance.  
While a person is waiting for test results, they should remain isolated from others. Where testing capacity is limited, tests should first be done for those at higher risk of infection, such as health workers, and those at higher risk of severe illness such as older people, especially those living in seniors’ residences or long-term care facilities.

7,7,"What test should I get to see if I have COVID-19?
","1. COVID-19 and influenza are both respiratory diseases.
Both viruses share similar symptoms, including cough, runny nose, sore throat, fever, headache and fatigue. People may have varying levels of illness with both COVID-19 and influenza. Some may have no symptoms, mild symptoms or severe disease. Both influenza and COVID-19 can be fatal.
2. COVID-19 and influenza spread in similar ways.
Both COVID-19 and influenza are spread by droplets and aerosols when an infected person coughs, sneezes, speaks, sings or breathes. The droplets and aerosols can land in the eyes, nose or mouth of people who are nearby -- typically within 1 meter of the infected person, but sometimes even further away. People can also get infected with both COVID-19 and influenza by touching contaminated surfaces, then touching their eyes, nose or mouth without cleaning their hands.  
3. Some of the same groups have a higher risk for severe illness from COVID-19 and influenza.
While all age groups can be infected with both the COVID-19 virus and influenza virus, these people are at higher risk for severe disease and death from both COVID-19 and influenza:
older adults;
people of any age with chronic medical conditions (such as chronic cardiac, pulmonary, renal, metabolic, neurologic, liver or hematologic diseases); and
people with immunosuppressive conditions (such as HIV/AIDS, patients receiving chemotherapy or steroids, or malignancy)
Healthcare workers are at high risk of getting infected by COVID-19 and at high risk of getting infected by influenza.
Pregnant people and those who have recently given birth are at high risk for experiencing severe influenza and severe COVID-19.  
4. The same protective measures are effective against COVID-19 and influenza.
To protect against COVID-19 and influenza, follow these public health and social measures:
Maintain at least a 1-meter distance from others and wear a well-fitted mask when that’s not possible;
Avoid crowded and poorly ventilated places and settings;
Open windows or doors to keep rooms well ventilated;
Cough or sneeze into a bent elbow or tissue and throw the tissue into a closed bin;
Clean your hands frequently
Avoid touching your eyes, nose and mouth;
Stay home if you don’t feel well; and
Contact your medical provider if you have any of the following severe severe symptoms of COVID-19, including:
Shortness of breath,
Loss of appetite,
Confusion,
Persistent pain or pressure in the chest,
High temperature (above 38 °C)
Vaccination is an important part of preventing severe disease and death for both COVID-19 and influenza. Follow the advice of your local authorities on getting the influenza and COVID-19 vaccines. WHO recommends the influenza vaccine for older individuals, young children, pregnant people, people with underlying health conditions, and health workers.
COVID-19 vaccines are safe for most people 18 years and older, including those with pre-existing conditions of any kind, including auto-immune disorders. These conditions include: hypertension, diabetes, asthma, pulmonary, liver and kidney disease, as well as chronic infections that are stable and controlled.
If supplies are limited in your area, discuss your situation with your care provider if you:
Have a compromised immune system
Are pregnant or nursing your baby
Have a history of severe allergies, particularly to a vaccine (or any of the ingredients in the vaccine)
Are severely frail
People with mild symptoms of both COVID-19 and influenza can usually be cared for safely at home. 
5. There are safe and effective vaccines for both COVID-19 and influenza.
COVID-19 vaccines have been proven to protect against severe illness and death caused by COVID-19 disease. Millions of people around the world have safely received COVID-19 vaccines, and the vaccines have met rigorous standards for safety, effectiveness and quality. Getting vaccinated may also protect the people around you. If you are protected from getting COVID-19, you are less likely to infect someone else. COVID-19 vaccines do not protect against influenza.
WHO recommends vaccinations each year to prevent severe influenza disease in high-risk groups: pregnant people, individuals with underlying health conditions, older adults, health workers, and young children.

8,8,What about rapid tests?,"Rapid antigen tests (sometimes known as a rapid diagnostic test – RDT) detect viral proteins (known as antigens). Samples are collected from the nose and/or throat with a swab. These tests are cheaper than PCR and will offer results more quickly, although they are generally less accurate. These tests perform best when there is more virus circulating in the community and when sampled from an individual during the time they are most infectious.","['sampl', 'infecti', 'commun', 'collect', 'le', 'throat', 'accur', 'nose', 'swab', 'test', 'known', 'diagnost', 'viral', 'circul', 'result', 'pcr', 'although', 'offer', 'cheaper', 'protein', 'rapid', 'quickli', 'sometim', 'antigen', 'perform', 'individu', 'gener', 'rdt', 'detect', 'best']"
9,9,"I want to find out if I had COVID-19 in the past, what test could I take? 
","Antibody tests can tell us whether someone has had an infection in the past, even if they have not had symptoms. Also known as serological tests and usually done on a blood sample, these tests detect antibodies produced in response to an infection. In most people, antibodies start to develop after days to weeks and can indicate if a person has had past infection. Antibody tests cannot be used to diagnose COVID-19 in the early stages of infection or disease but can indicate whether or not someone has had the disease in the past.","['sampl', 'diseas', 'even', 'whether', 'usual', 'want', 'diagnos', 'cannot', 'done', 'tell', 'test', 'find', 'known', 'earli', 'blood', 'person', 'week', 'day', 'past', 'produc', 'indic', 'start', 'antibodi', 'detect', 'infect', 'serolog', 'could', 'someon', 'respons', 'stage']"
10,10,What is the difference between isolation and quarantine?,"Both isolation and quarantine are methods of preventing the spread of COVID-19.
Quarantine is used for anyone who is in contact with someone infected with the SARS-CoV-2 virus, which causes COVID-19, whether the infected person has symptoms or not. Quarantine means that you remain separated from others because you have been exposed to the virus and you may be infected and can take place in a designated facility or at home. For COVID-19, this means staying in the facility or at home for 14 days.
Isolation is used for people with COVID-19 symptoms or who have tested positive for the virus. Being in isolation means being separated from other people, ideally in a medically facility where you can receive clinical care.  If isolation in a medical facility is not possible and you are not in a high risk group of developing severe disease, isolation can take place at home. If you have symptoms, you should remain in isolation for at least 10 days plus an additional 3 days without symptoms. If you are infected and do not develop symptoms, you should remain in isolation for 10 days from the time you test positive.

11,11,What should I do if I have been exposed to someone who has COVID-19?,"If you have been exposed to someone with COVID-19, you may become infected, even if you feel well.
After exposure to someone who has COVID-19, do the following:
Call your healthcare provider or COVID-19 hotline to find out where and when to get a test.
Cooperate with contact-tracing procedures to stop the spread of the virus.
If testing is not available, stay home and away from others for 14 days.
While you are in quarantine, do not go to work, to school or to public places. Ask someone to bring you supplies.
Keep at least a 1-meter distance from others, even from your family members.
Wear a medical mask to protect others, including if/when you need to seek medical care.
Clean your hands frequently.
Stay in a separate room from other family members, and if not possible, wear a medical mask.
Keep the room well-ventilated.
If you share a room, place beds at least 1 meter apart.
Monitor yourself for any symptoms for 14 days. 
Stay positive by keeping in touch with loved ones by phone or online, and by exercising at home.
If you live in an area with malaria or dengue fever, seek medical help if you have a fever. While traveling to and from the health facility and during medical care, wear a mask, keep at least a 1-meter distance from other people and avoid touching surfaces with your hands.

12,12,"How long does it take to develop symptoms?
","The time from exposure to COVID-19 to the moment when symptoms begin is, on average, 5-6 days and can range from 1-14 days. This is why people who have been exposed to the virus are advised to remain at home and stay away from others, for 14 days, in order to prevent the spread of the virus, especially where testing is not easily available.

13,13,"Is there a vaccine for COVID-19?
","Yes. The first mass vaccination programme started in early December 2020 and the number of vaccination doses administered is updated on a daily basis here. At least 13 different vaccines (across 4 platforms) have been administered. Campaigns have started in 206 economies.
The Pfizer/BioNtech Comirnaty vaccine was listed for WHO Emergency Use Listing (EUL) on 31 December 2020. The SII/Covishield and AstraZeneca/AZD1222 vaccines (developed by AstraZeneca/Oxford and manufactured by the Serum Institute of India and SK Bio respectively) were given EUL on 16 February. The Janssen/Ad26.COV 2.S developed by Johnson & Johnson, was listed for EUL on 12 March 2021. The Moderna COVID-19 vaccine (mRNA 1273) was listed for EUL on 30 April 2021 and the Sinopharm COVID-19 vaccine was listed for EUL on 7 May 2021. The Sinopharm vaccine is produced by Beijing Bio-Institute of Biological Products Co Ltd, subsidiary of China National Biotec Group (CNBG).
Once vaccines are demonstrated to be safe and efficacious, they must be approved by national regulators, manufactured to exacting standards, and distributed. WHO is working with partners around the world to help coordinate key steps in this process, including to facilitate equitable access to safe and effective COVID-19 vaccines for the billions of people who will need them.

15,15,Are there treatments for COVID-19?,"Scientists around the world are working to find and develop treatments for COVID-19.
Optimal supportive care includes oxygen for severely ill patients and those who are at risk for severe disease and more advanced respiratory support such as ventilation for patients who are critically ill.
Dexamethasone is a corticosteroid that can help reduce the length of time on a ventilator and save lives of patients with severe and critical illness.
Results from the WHO’s Solidarity Trial indicated that remade sivir, hydroxychloroquine, lopinavir/ritonavir and interferon regimens appear to have little or no effect on 28-day mortality or the in-hospital course of COVID-19 among hospitalized patients.
Hydroxychloroquine has not been shown to offer any benefit for treatment of COVID-19. 
WHO does not recommend self-medication with any medicines, including antibiotics, as a prevention or cure for COVID-19. WHO is coordinating efforts to develop treatments for COVID-19 and will continue to provide new information as it becomes available.

16,16,"Are antibiotics effective in preventing or treating COVID-19?
","Antibiotics do not work against viruses; they only work on bacterial infections. COVID-19 is caused by a virus, so antibiotics do not work. Antibiotics should not be used as a means of prevention or treatment of COVID-19.
In hospitals, physicians will sometimes use antibiotics to prevent or treat secondary bacterial infections which can be a complication of COVID-19 in severely ill patients. They should only be used as directed by a physician to treat a bacterial infection.

17,17,"Are people living with HIV at increased risk of being infected with SARS-CoV-2 or develop more severe COVID-19?
","People living with HIV (PLHIV) who have not achieved viral suppression through antiretroviral treatment (ART) may have a compromised immune system that leaves them vulnerable to opportunistic infections and further HIV disease progression. There is no clinical evidence that PLHIV has a higher risk of infection with SARS-CoV-2 when compared with HIV-negative people. 
There are several small studies conducted early in the pandemic that describe the clinical presentation of COVID-19 in PLHIV, indicating that the clinical presentation of COVID-19 is similar in people with and without HIV, particularly if they are on ART and have achieved HIV viral suppression However, global data compiled by WHO from almost 350 000 patients in 38 countries indicate that PLHIV are at increased risk for development of severe illness and death due to COVID-19. This analysis found that the risk of developing severe fatal COVID-19 was 38% greater in this population when compared to people without HIV infection . PLHIV frequently faces adverse social determinants of health and structural factors that may lead to higher SARS-CoV-2 exposure. They also have a high prevalence of some comorbidities associated with poorer COVID-19 outcomes, such as cardiovascular disease, diabetes, chronic respiratory disease and hypertension. Additionally, lower CD4 T-cell counts are associated with advanced HIV disease and several epidemiological studies are suggesting that this HIV subpopulation is at greater risk for hospitalization due to COVID-19 and mortality. 
Taken all these considerations together, there is no clear evidence of a higher risk for PLHIV to be infected with SARS-COV-2 when compared with the general population. However, those with advanced HIV disease, those with low CD4 T-cell counts and high HIV viral load and those who are not taking ART have an increased risk of COVID-19 complications in general.

18,18,"Should the treatment or prevention of COVID-19 be different in people living with HIV?
","Current recommendations for COVID-19 clinical management in people living with HIV generally do not differ from those of the general population, including treatment and prevention measures. 
PLHIV are as eligible to receive anti-SARS-CoV-2 therapies as people without HIV infection and those individuals with advanced HIV disease should be considered as a high priority.
When starting treatment for COVID-19 in patients with HIV, clinicians should pay careful attention to potential interactions between drugs and overlapping toxicities among COVID-19 treatments, antiretrovirals (ARV), antimicrobial therapies, and other medications. 
PLHIV who develop COVID-19 should continue their ARV regimen, opportunistic infection treatment and prophylaxis whenever possible. The ARV regimen should not be switched or adjusted (i.e., by adding ARV drugs to the regimen) for the purpose of preventing or treating SARS-CoV-2 infection.
Individuals who know their HIV status are advised to take the same COVID-19 precautions as the general population (e.g., wash hands often, practice cough hygiene, avoid touching your face, social distancing, seek medical care if symptomatic, self-isolation if in contact with someone with COVID-19 and other actions recommended in the government’s response). PLHIV who are taking ARV drugs should ensure that they have at least 30 days of ARVs, if not a 3- to 6-month supply.
It is also an important opportunity to ensure that all PLHIV who are not yet on antiretroviral treatment begin to do so.  People who feel they may have been at HIV risk are advised to seek testing to protect against HIV disease progression and complications from any other health issues.

19,19,"Can antiretrovirals be used to treat COVID-19 or prevent SARS-CoV-2 infection?
","No ARVs are currently recommended by WHO to treat or prevent COVID-19. Initial in vitro, animal and small human observational studies conducted during previous coronavirus outbreaks (SARS and MERS) and in the early phases of the COVID-19 pandemic have suggested that some ARVs, such as lopinavir/ritonavir (LPV/r), could help against SARS-CoV-2 and should be repurposed for treatment and prevention of COVID-19. This hypothesis was subsequently assessed in further observational studies and in large randomized controlled trials, but no clinical benefit or impact on disease severity or mortality were demonstrated (2).   
Several observational studies also indicated that use of tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (TDF) and tenofovir alafenamide (TAF) could be associated with lower risk of acquiring SARS-CoV-2 and developing severe COVID-19. However, these studies had limitations and may have been influenced by other health issues in the participants.. Subsequent larger observational studies and clinical trials have not found a relationship between TDF or TAF and risk of SARS-CoV-2 acquisition or severe outcomes.   
While the evidence of benefit of using ARVs to treat coronavirus infections was not demonstrated, serious side effects from these drugs were not rare. The routine use of LPV/r and TDF or TAF as part of treatment regimens for HIV can be associated with several side effects of moderate severity. 
Therefore, at this time there is no evidence to suggest that any particular ARV agent improves or worsens COVID-19 clinical outcomes in PLHIV, or can be used for prevention of SARS-CoV-2 infection. WHO recommends maintaining the standard approaches to initiation and continuation of ART in PLHIV, with a focus on reducing HIV-associated immune compromise and achievement of virologic suppression. The same principles are applicable for use of pre-exposure prophylaxis (PreP) or post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP) regimens for HIV prevention.

20,20,"Are COVID-19 vaccines safe for people living with HIV? 
","Many of the initial clinical studies with COVID-19 vaccines have included a small number of people living with HIV (PLHIV) in their trials. Despite limited data, available information from those studies suggests that current WHO recommended COVID-19 vaccines  are safe for PLHIV. The currently available COVID-19 vaccine products are not live vaccines but include modified viral proteins or genetic material from SARS-CoV-2 which cannot replicate or cause changes to human genes. More recent observational studies have further evaluated the safety of COVID-19 vaccines in this population and didn’t find any evidence of a higher rate of unusual side effects after vaccination when compared with the general population. In addition, no pharmacological interactions have been reported between COVID-19 vaccines and antiretroviral medications (ARV) which PLHIV should continue to take after vaccination to maintain health.
Recently, a debate in the scientific community has led to broader concerns about a potential association observed more than a decade ago between adenovirus vector-based vaccines and an increased risk of acquiring HIV infection among men who received this type of vaccine. This unexpected finding was detected in two HIV vaccine trials that used adenovirus type 5 (Ad5) vector containing products. The reason for this observed increase in the HIV acquisition risk remains uncertain, although several hypothetical mechanisms have suggested a possible interference in the HIV specific vaccine response or in the CD4 T-cell susceptibility to HIV infection induced by pre-existing adenovirus- associated immunity in combination with other factors.  However, a third study also using Ad5 vector-based HIV vaccine has not reported this finding .
Despite these potential concerns, it is important to highlight that the benefits of all authorized COVID-19 vaccines in a pandemic context largely outweigh this potential risk. The theoretical concern on increased risk of HIV acquisition is confined to a specific Ad5 vectored HIV vaccine and should not be extended to other vaccine platforms. However, as several COVID-19 vaccines are using human and animal adenovirus vector platforms, specific studies are encouraged to better assess the safety of Ad5 vectored COVID-19 vaccines in sub-populations at high risk of HIV acquisition. An extended follow-up from a Phase III study of an Ad5 vectored COVID-19 vaccine is currently evaluating HIV seroconversion rates in the participants, and interim results are expected at the end of 2022. 
Global data have shown that PLHIV have a 38% greater risk of developing severe or fatal COVID-19 compared to people without HIV infection. For this reason, it is important to prioritize PLHIV to receive the COVID-19 vaccine. People with stable HIV disease have been included in several COVID-19 vaccine trials, and specific cohort studies on COVID-19 vaccines with PLHIV have been recently rolled out. Therefore, more information on this topic specific to PLHIV is expected in the future. WHO will continue to monitor the situation as new data become available and SAGE recommendations will be updated accordingly.

21,21,Do COVID-19 vaccines provide protection for people living with HIV?,"Current available studies on the efficacy of COVID-19 vaccines in PLHIV with high CD4 T-cell counts and using ART, indicate that most of these individuals produce antibody levels and cellular immune response in the same range observed in people without HIV infection, suggesting that current recommended COVID-19 vaccines are safe and protective in this population. However, there is data in these studies from individuals with low CD4 T-cell counts (i.e., below 200 cells/mm3) or without HIV viral suppression that show a reduced immune response to the COVID-19 vaccine. Furthermore, the antibody responses after vaccination may dwindle faster than people with higher CD4 T-cell counts. 
This reduced immune response to COVID-19 vaccines has also been reported in individuals with other causes of severe immunodeficiency (e.g., solid and hematologic malignancies, people with organ transplants and in hemodialysis). Suboptimal immune response against certain vaccine preventable diseases has also been demonstrated in people with advanced HIV disease and/or lower CD4 T-cell counts. 
Higher rates of SARS-CoV-2 infection after primary vaccination (i.e., breakthrough infections) among PLHIV when compared with people without HIV have been described. A population-level analysis conducted in immunocompromised patients indicated a 33% higher incidence rate of breakthrough SARS-CoV-2 infections among PLHIV, albeit without accounting for HIV-specific factors. 
Additionally, a large HIV cohort study with more than 100 000 individuals vaccinated and with good HIV control showed a low overall (3.8%) but 28% higher risk of breakthrough infection without association with HIV viral load or CD4 T-cell counts. The breakthrough rate was also higher in people with vs without HIV (55 cases per 1000 person-years vs 43 cases per 1000 person-years) . 
These higher rates and risk of breakthrough infections observed in PLHIV when compared with the general population should not be a reason to postpone or to avoid COVID-19 vaccines in these patients, who have a higher risk of COVID-19 complications and death. It supports the recommendation for the use of additional primary doses in this population as in other immunocompromised groups. 
Furthermore, national COVID-19 immunization programmes should not exclude people from key and vulnerable populations at risk of HIV, who frequently have limited access to health services. WHO will continue to monitor emerging evidence and will provide timely guidance updates.

22,22,"Should people living with HIV get vaccines early in the roll out?
","WHO currently recommends that PLHIV should be included as a priority population for COVID-19 immunization. It has been supported by growing evidence suggesting that PLHIV, particularly those with advanced HIV disease, lower CD4 T-cell count, or non-suppressed viral load appear to be at increased risk of poor outcomes and death due to COVID-19 when compared with people without HIV infection. Furthermore, many PLHIV have 1 or more chronic comorbidities that may put them at increased risk of severe COVID-19 or death, independent from their HIV disease or immune status. Therefore, PLHIV, particularly those with comorbidities (such chronic obstructive pulmonary diseases, diabetes, heart, kidney, liver, motor neurone or Parkinson disease, multiple sclerosis, severe obesity) should be prioritized for COVID-19 vaccination.
Many countries have included PLHIV as a priority group for COVID-19 vaccination according to their epidemiological context, prioritizing vaccination for all PLHIV or those who are immunocompromised (as indicated by having a CD4 T-cell count <200/mm3).  In mid-2021, according to an informal WHO poll survey conducted with more than 100 countries from all regions, more than 40 have established a COVID-19 immunization policy that prioritizes vaccinations for PLHIV. However, the real coverage of COVID-19 vaccination among PLHIV in countries varies widely. A regional survey conducted at the end of 2021 in central and eastern Europe found that PLHIV had been prioritized for COVID-19 vaccination in 8 of the 22 countries and only 3 countries had formulated guidelines for the vaccination of PLHIV. A recent study conducted in New York State, USA, found that COVID-19 vaccination coverage among PLHIV was lower than that in the general adult population (63.5% vs 75.0%).
Differences in demographic composition between PLHIV and the general population might partly explain lower coverage; however, coverage was 75% lower across all examined PLHIV subgroups. Unmeasured structural factors, including socioeconomic status, might further explain the lower COVID-19 vaccination coverage among this group. As countries are in different stages of the COVID-19 pandemic and vaccine rollout and have different demographic structure, they should also refer to the  WHO SAGE Roadmap for Prioritizing Uses of COVID-19 Vaccines  for operational details.

23,23,"Should all people living with HIV receive additional doses of COVID-19 vaccine?
","Currently approved COVID-19 vaccines are safe and effective in most PLHIV, with significant reduction in the risk of severe COVID-19 disease or death when the standard regimen (currently 1 or 2 doses of the approved COVID-19 vaccine depending on the product) is fully taken as recommended. However, there is growing evidence of a suboptimal immune response to the standard course of COVID-19 vaccination in people with moderate to severe immunodeficiency, including those with advanced HIV disease, lower CD4 T-cell counts, or unsuppressed viral load.
Therefore, in people with moderate to severe advanced HIV disease, an additional vaccine dose should be administered as part of the extended primary series and should be given 1–3 months after the completion of the primary series to enhance the immune response and increase protection. This approach is recommended by WHO as well as several other major COVID-19 guidelines.
A gradual reduction of vaccine effectiveness against SARS-CoV-2 infection has been observed after the completion of primary COVID-19 vaccine series, even in those individuals without clinical immunodeficiency and with good initial response to the primary vaccine course. Many countries are now recommending the administration of an additional vaccine dose as a booster in all individuals, including PLHIV who are asymptomatic or mild clinical immunodeficiency and CD4 counts above 200 T-cells/mm3 and virologically suppressed. This booster dose can be taken 4 to 6 months after the completion of the primary vaccination series . The objective of the booster doses strategy is to restore vaccine effectiveness from that deemed no longer sufficient. Some countries are implementing a second booster dose for their highest risk populations, including people with moderate to severe advanced HIV disease, 3–5 months after an initial booster dose . More data on the waning of protective immunity and vaccine effectiveness against severe disease and hospitalization after an initial booster dose is required before WHO endorsed recommendation on the additional booster dose. According to the WHO SAGE roadmap, the highest priority continues to be ensuring that all PLHIV receive their primary vaccine series against COVID-19, complemented by an additional dose in those with advanced HIV disease.
Risk of development of immune escape variants in immunosuppressed patients
People with moderate to severe immunodeficiency have an increased risk of developing severe COVID-19 and suffering from a long-term persistent infection with prolonged viral shedding due to suboptimal immune response. 
For persons with immune dysfunction, continued use of nonpharmaceutical interventions (e.g., facial mask wearing) and alternative vaccine strategies (e.g., additional vaccine doses or immunogenicity testing) are recommended even after full vaccination.
This situation can create an environment for immune escape and selection of evolutionary variants. Several case reports indicated that multi-mutational SARS-CoV-2 variants can arise during such persistent infections in immunocompromised individuals and could result in novel SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern. 
The findings that immunocompromised patients with persistent SARS-CoV-2 infection may generate new SARS-CoV-2 variants have several medical and public health implications. Heightened precautions should be taken to avert nosocomial transmission of COVID-19 among immunocompromised patients. Such patients should be prioritized for anti-COVID-19 immunization not only to protect them but also to mitigate persistent SARS-CoV-2 infections.

","WHO is providing support and direction to the scientific community and welcomes the research and development of effective tests, vaccines, medicines and other interventions for COVID-19.
For public health emergencies, WHO has a systematic and transparent process for research and development, including for clinical trials of new drugs and vaccines. The WHO R&D Blueprint for COVID-19, initiated on 7 January 2020, will serve as the global strategy for research and development activities. Its aim is to fast-track the availability of effective tests, vaccines and medicines that can be used to save lives and avert large scale crises. As part of this, WHO is leading the global prioritization of candidate vaccines and therapeutics for development and evaluation. To support testing, WHO convened a scientific advisory group to develop guidance on trial designs for experimental vaccines and therapeutics.
WHO is actively following the ongoing clinical trials for existing antivirals and other medicines that are being conducted for COVID-19. WHO continues to emphasize that all clinical trials should and must follow stringent ethical and regulatory standards. Regulatory authorities have a role to play to ensure close oversight of all clinical trials that will be undertaken.

","While WHO is working with countries to ensure fair and equitable access to safe and effective COVID-19 vaccines, it is important to continue actions to prevent SARS-CoV-2 transmission and to reduce COVID-19 deaths. Alongside the response to COVID-19, it is critical to maintain access to essential health services. This includes:
supporting PLHIV to continue taking antiretroviral therapy (ART) and adapting services to make this easier and more efficient during the COVID-19 response;
continuing to provide HIV prevention and testing services with linkage to ART initiation as a priority;
ensuring those who start ART can remain on it to reduce health risks and complications during COVID-19. This must be classified as an essential service, together with prevention, diagnosis and treatment of co-morbidities and co-infections; and
monitoring all PLHIV and SARS-CoV-2 infections, especially those with advanced HIV disease or with comorbidities.
Although there may be an increase in the risk of developing severe disease from COVID-19 among PLHIV, making sure that people have access to effective ART and other health care services they need will help minimize this risk.

","Yes. Infected people in all age groups – including adolescents - can transmit the virus to other people, even if they have mild symptoms or do not feel ill.
The virus is spread from person to person through liquid particles such as aerosols (smaller) and droplets (larger) from the nose or mouth which are spread when a person with COVID-19 coughs, sneezes or speaks. People can catch COVID-19 if they breathe in these droplets from an adolescent infected with the virus.  Therefore, it is important to stay at least 1 meter away from others. These droplets can land on objects and surfaces. People can then become infected by touching these objects or surfaces, and then touching their eyes, nose or mouth.

If you have minor symptoms, such as a slight cough or a mild fever, and no risk factors for severe disease there is generally no need to go to a healthcare facility. Your health provider will assess the situation and give instructions when and where to get a test, stay at home for 14 days away from others and monitor your health.
Seek medical care immediately if your health gets worse, or if there is no one in your family that can take care of you at home.

30,30,"I was due to get vaccinated for HPV, meningitis or tetanus, but immunization services have been disrupted. Should I be concerned?","WHO recommends that countries continue routine immunization services wherever feasible. For example, school-based vaccination initiatives should continue only if infection prevention and control measures are implemented to avoid increased risk of transmission of the COVID-19 virus among the students, school personnel and health care providers. However, vaccines provided to adolescents have sufficiently flexible schedules to make sure you can get the vaccine in time when vaccination services start again. For example, the HPV vaccine that requires two doses can be started anytime between 9 and 14 years of age and the interval between the two doses can be longer. The minimum interval between doses is 6 months, but it can be 12 or 15 months and, if necessary, even longer. It is most important that you receive the second dose at some point in time to be fully protected.
Decisions to continue routine vaccination services are made by each country. Ask a family member or another trusted adult how you can get information about vaccination services where you live.  It is important you get the vaccines you are supposed to get, even if they have to be delayed due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

Check with your health authorities and health provider if your regular check-ups should be done differently during the COVID-19 pandemic. Some services, such as counseling, may be available remotely. For treatment of clinically stable adolescents with HIV and adolescents with TB and/or other chronic conditions, your health provider should consider multi-month prescriptions and dispensing which will reduce the frequency of your visits to the clinic and ensure continuity of treatment, if movements are disrupted during the pandemic.

Try to stay connected with friends and family every day either by communicating with them by phone or internet if you can, or, if you live close to them and the local rules allow you to, by talking in-person while keeping your distance. You can also get involved with your community to help fight the transmission of the virus.
At the same time, it is still really important that you reduce your chances of being infected or spreading COVID-19 by washing your hands with soap and water or alcohol-based hand rub as often as possible, keeping at least 1 meter (3 feet) from other people, and avoiding crowded places.

35,35,"COVID-19 makes me really anxious. I feel worried and at times have difficulty coping with stress. What should I do?
","In situations like a pandemic it is very normal to feel anxious and powerless, and that is ok. Here are a few suggestions on things that could help you proactively manage your anxiety:
TIP 1: DO THINGS THAT ARE GOOD FOR YOUR BODY AND MIND
Your body and mind are connected. Here are some things you can do to keep them healthy:
• Stay active! Being physically active is good for your body and can help your mind feel better too. If you can go outside, try a walk, run, bike ride, or any other sport. If indoors, try dancing, stretching, or any other movement you can do. Find what works for you – and do it!
• Eat well! Try to make healthy choices about what you eat if you can.
• Take notice of yourself and the world around you. This means becoming more aware of your breathing, your body and your surroundings. Try to BE PRESENT in the moment!
• Sleep! Try to get the right balance of sleep each night. This will help you grow well, stay healthy, and keep clear thoughts.
•  Find things that make you happy and do those things more! Listening to music, reading, playing games, chatting with friends, growing plants, cooking, drawing, playing sports…there are many possibilities! Perhaps even try something new! Just make sure that during these activities you respect physical distancing and other protection measures that are in place in your country.
TIP 2: STAY CONNECTED TO LOVED ONES
Keep in touch with your family and friends however you can. Use social media, email, phone calls, write a letter! Be creative. And if you can’t connect, then think about a memory of a shared time together.
TIP 3: RECOGNISE HOW YOU ARE FEELING
Understanding how you feel is important. Don’t ignore it. Sometimes writing your feelings down can help you to describe it. It might sound easy or simple, but try this “I feel ....... right now”.
TIP 4: BE KIND TO YOURSELF
It is okay to feel however it is that you’re feeling. Putting pressure on yourself to always ‘be happy’ or ‘stay positive’ or ‘stay productive’ can sometimes make you feel worse. Instead, if you notice you are experiencing difficult emotions, try telling yourself: “I feel worried and scared, but that does not mean I am not coping.” “It’s been a tough time, it’s okay to be upset.” “I am feeling [insert how you are feeling] and that is okay.” “These are difficult times, it’s normal to feel upset.”
Or think of something to tell yourself that works for you.
TIP 5: LISTEN TO YOUR BODY
Our body experiences and reacts to how we feel. Do you often get headaches? Do your shoulders, chest, or stomach sometimes feel tense? Try closing your eyes, and listening to your own breathing. Notice how you feel in each part of your body, starting from your head down to your toes. Notice if you are feeling any tightness, pain, or pressure in your body. Being aware of where you are feeling tension can help you release it.
TIP 6: TRY USING YOUR BREATH TO CALM YOURSELF
Slow breathing is one of the quickest ways of calming down the body when we experience feelings such as fear, worry or anger. Close your eyes and think of a calm place. Imagine yourself there, feeling relaxed.
• Focus on breathing slowly.
• Breathe in for a slow count of 3 and out for a slow count of 3.
• Practice this for a few minutes.
How do you feel after?
TIP 7: AVOID UNHEALTHY WAYS OF COPING WITH STRESS
When you are experiencing difficult feelings, it is important to find healthy ways to take care of yourself.

39,39,"Should I wear a mask at school or when playing sports?
","You should not wear a mask when playing sports or doing physical activities, such as running, jumping or playing on the playground, so that it doesn’t compromise your breathing. However, remember to maintain at least a 1-meter distance from others, limit the number of friends playing together, and respect hand hygiene.
Regarding wearing masks in schools and other public places, WHO advises that people always consult and abide by local authorities on recommended practices in their area. In countries or areas where there is intense community transmission of the virus and in settings where physical distancing cannot be achieved, WHO and UNICEF advise decision makers to apply the following criteria for use of masks in schools (either in classes, corridors or communal areas) when developing national policies:
• Children aged 5 years and under should not be required to wear masks.
• For children between six and 11 years of age, the decision to use a mask will vary from place to place, and will depend on several factors, such as the intensity of transmission in the area where the child lives, local norms that influence social interactions, the child’s capacity to comply with the appropriate use of masks and availability of appropriate adult supervision, and other factors.
• Children and adolescents 12 years or older should follow the national mask guidelines for adults.

40,40,"I am spending much more time online on social media, playing games and studying. Should I be worried about this?
","COVID-19 has abruptly pushed many people’s daily lives online, and you may be spending even more hours online than before. While online solutions provide huge opportunities for continuing your learning, socializing and playing, you should try to limit the amount of screen time that is not related to your studies or physical activity. This is because you need to be physically active to keep healthy and have a positive attitude. In addition, some people are sensitive to flickering lights and may get headaches, nausea, and dizziness, and even seizures if they spend too much time in front of a screen. Therefore, it is important to replace some of the recreational screen time with non-screen activities, like listening to music, reading, playing board games, and physical activity, like going for a walk or jog. Excessive gaming can lead to “gaming disorder” that leads to reduced sleep or day-night reversal, loss of appetite, aggression, headaches, and attention problems. If you experience these symptoms, seek help from your parents or a trusted adult.

41,41,"I heard I can be hurt by online contacts. What are my risks and how can I protect myself online? 
","Since you might be spending even more time online than before, it is wise to be aware of some of the risks. First, be careful what content you share online. Risky behavior, such as sexting or sharing of sexualized content, can expose you to risks of blackmail, harassment and humiliation. Second, spending more time online may increase the chances that you could come into contact with online predators who seek to sexually exploit young people. When in front of webcams wear appropriate clothing and avoid using private instant messaging services in your communication with teachers. In addition, it’s important to note that some adolescents – for example those with disabilities and those perceived to be different or at greater risk of catching or spreading COVID-19 - may be at increased risk of cyberbullying and discrimination. Hurtful, discriminatory or inappropriate online contact is never okay. If in doubt, or if you feel uncomfortable or distressed about some interactions you have online, tell a parent or another trusted adult immediately.

42,42,"Since my parents stopped going out to work, they have been arguing with each other much more, and in some instances, I have seen one parent harm or hurt the other either verbally or physically. I don’t feel safe at home. What should I do?
","This is a difficult time. Many people – including perhaps your parents - are worrying about security, health, and money. When people are in cramped and confined living conditions, these tensions and stress can become even greater. It is normal to have disagreements. However, if the disagreements become verbal or physical, then it is right to take action. 
If you are worried about what is happening in your home, or don’t feel safe, talk to a trusted adult about what worries you, and seek their advice. During an argument or a fight, try not to draw attention to yourself so that you don’t end up getting hurt. It might be useful to have a safety plan in case the violence escalates. This includes preparing a bag with essential items, like clothing, documents and electric charger, and having a neighbor, friend, relative, or shelter identified to go to should you need to leave the house immediately for safety reasons. Arrange with the trusted adult to help you alert the relevant authorities who can help you stay safe, including the police, emergency health services and social services.
In many of the countries that have been most affected by COVID-19, essential services are still available, including shelters or protection services. If there are no trusted adults for you to share your concerns with, your country may have helplines, including text services so that you can communicate with someone who can help you or give you advice.

43,43,"Is it safe to have sex at this time?
","There is no evidence that COVID-19 is transmitted through semen or vaginal fluids. However, having sex with someone means that you are very close to them. This puts one person at risk if the other person has COVID-19. Masturbation does not involve another person and carries no risk of COVID-19. Depending on the government guideline, there might be restrictions in place to meet people outside your household, so it is important you follow these guidelines. Your risk of COVID-19 is not increased if you already live in the same household as your sexual partner and you are both taking steps to protect yourself from the virus. Make sure to use condoms and contraception to avoid sexually transmitted infections and unintended pregnancy.

44,44,"I don’t like the way someone touches me at home and we are both at home all the time because of the pandemic. What should I do?
","It is wrong for anyone to do this. And it is not your fault in any way. If you are staying in the same house as the person and/or are dependent on him (it will usually be a man), that may make some of the things that you could do difficult, especially during stay-at-home restrictions due to COVID-19. Here are some things that you can consider doing to improve your safety while in the house.
You could tell him politely but firmly that you do not want him to touch you and ask him to please stop.
You could inform your parents or other caregivers or a trusted adult in the house about what is happening.
You could inform a trusted adult outside your home such as a neighbor or a teacher or family friend or relative.
If you have access to a phone, you could call or text for help and support. This includes calling hotlines/helplines for children and women who are in need of help or feeling distressed or subjected to abuse, or calling a child protection service in your area. Be careful not to leave your phone calls or text messages where anyone else could access them. 
If you need to leave the house immediately because he is hurting or harming you, think of discretely (without him overhearing) pre-arranging with a neighbor or trusted relative or family friend to help you leave the house and stay with them until it is safe for you to return home.
 If you have been sexually abused or raped and need urgent medical help or care, go as soon as possible to the nearest hospital or clinic to ask for medical care.

45,45,When will this pandemic end so things can go back to normal?,"We don’t know when the pandemic will end, but we know it depends on every person’s contribution in helping stop the spread of the virus. The sacrifices you have made by not seeing your friends and by not going to school for a while, and other activities, are your contributions to fighting the pandemic. By putting societies and economies on hold, we have reduced the ability of the virus to spread through our communities. These defensive measures have helped to limit the damage the virus can cause, and bought us time to learn more about the virus and find solutions so that we can get back to a more familiar way of living. This is why it was possible to reopen schools and businesses in many places. It is important that you continue to practice the recommended measures and encourage your friends to do the same to prevent the situation from getting worse.
I feel like my future has been affected. I am not able to apply for the jobs I wanted, and now that I have a new job I find it hard to be noticed when remote working.
The anonymity of working from home is really taking a toll on people and it is normal if you are feeling a bit forgotten and lost. It can feel difficult to get the attention you deserve and get your work noticed, especially if this is a new job and you do not yet know your manager and other colleagues well.  If you have a comfortable relationship with your supervisor it may be helpful to discuss whether adjustments to your workload, work schedule or other work-related matters can be made. This conversation could also be held with the person responsible for human resources at work.
There are many things you can do to feel more comfortable in the new job while working remotely. Ask your supervisor to access training on remote working and personal effectiveness skills.  Using your time to access learning and training opportunities can not only help you develop skills for your current role but also prepare you for future roles you may desire. Agree with your manager to have regular check-in calls where you can keep your supervisor aware of accomplishments with an informative summary. If you have regular team meetings, use this as an opportunity to flag your key successes, and let your co-workers know you better. Invite your colleagues with whom you haven’t connected yet to virtual coffee dates. Don’t be shy to volunteer for new projects, and offer help to your colleagues when you can.
When solutions to problems are hard to find, it can help to talk through with people who you trust, who may be able to help or can be a person to discuss ideas with - ranging from friends, to our work colleagues or supervisors or HR or to external advisors such as career guidance and job-seeking support. Many public employment offices have moved their services online and can offer you great insights about the labor market, vacancies and training opportunities.
If you feel your mental health is taking a big toll and it's affecting you much more than expected (such as affecting how well you work) then consider the following 1) engaging in stress management techniques – as reduced stress can help to improve our problem solving thinking (see Doing What Matters in Times of Stress and Managing work-related psychosocial risks during the COVID-19 pandemic); 2) if you are still in work, consider reaching out to your staff health or human resources services who may be able to help you find to mental health and psychosocial support at work or through your local health services including online support.

46,46,"What can we do so that other diseases like COVID-19 do not affect us in future?
","COVID-19 is a zoonotic disease which means that it existed naturally in animals before it spilled over to humans. Most new or emerging infectious diseases —whether in wildlife, domestic animals, plants or people — are driven by human activities that lead to environmental degradation. Human pressures, from deforestation, to intensive and polluting agricultural practices, to unsafe management and consumption of wildlife, increase the risk of new or emerging infectious diseases. This is why the number of emerging infectious disease outbreaks has increased steadily since 1980.  
To prevent the disastrous effects of emerging infectious diseases, we have to recognize that human health is intimately connected to the health of animals and our shared environment, and take action. Millions of young people have already mobilized to demand action not only on climate and biodiversity - but also for the right to breathe clean air, and for their future on a liveable planet.

63,63,"Should my child wear a mask?
","Decisions about mask use in children should be driven by what is in the best interest of the child. Mask use should be flexible, so that children can continue play, education and everyday activities. These activities are an important part of child development and health. No child should be denied access to school or activities because of lack of a mask.
Some countries and regions may have specific policies or recommendations in place. As always, follow the guidance provided by your country or local health department or ministry.
WHO and UNICEF recommend the following:
Children aged 5 years and under do not need to wear a mask because in this age group, they may not be able to properly wear a mask without help or supervision.
2. In areas where SARS-CoV-2 is spreading, children ages 6-11 years are recommended to wear a well-fitted mask
in indoor settings where ventilation is poor or unknown, even if physical distancing of at least 1 meter can be maintained; and
in indoor settings that have adequate ventilation when physical distancing of at least 1 meter cannot be maintained.  
3. Adolescents 12 years or older should follow the same WHO recommendations for mask use as adults:
A well-fitted mask that covers the nose and mouth should be worn in settings where SARS CoV-2 is spreading, regardless of vaccination status or history of prior infection, when interacting with individuals who are not members of their household:
in indoor settings where ventilation is known to be poor or cannot be assessed, or the ventilation system is not properly maintained, regardless of whether physical distancing of at least 1 meter can be maintained
in indoor settings that have adequate ventilation if physical distancing of at least 1 meter cannot be maintained; or
in outdoor settings where physical distancing of at least 1 meter cannot be maintained.
As much as possible, it is important that children of all ages keep their hands clean when putting on and taking off their mask.
A safe environment should be created for children who are not able to tolerate a mask, including requirements for caregivers, teachers or other adults interacting with the child to wear a mask and to be vaccinated against COVID-19 according to national vaccination policies.

Alcohol at 70-90% can also be used for surface disinfection. Surfaces must be cleaned with water and soap or a detergent first to remove dirt, followed by disinfection.  Cleaning should always start from the least soiled (cleanest) area to the most soiled (dirtiest) area in order to not spread the dirt to areas that are less soiled.
All disinfectant solutions should be stored in opaque containers, in a well-ventilated, covered area that is not exposed to direct sunlight and ideally should be freshly prepared every day.
In indoor spaces, routine application of disinfectants to surfaces via spraying is not recommended for COVID-19. If disinfectants are to be applied, these should be via a cloth or wipe which is soaked in the disinfectant.

75,75,"What protection measures should people take when using disinfectants?
","It is important to reduce your risk when using disinfectants:
The disinfectant and its concentration should be carefully selected to avoid damaging surfaces and to avoid or minimize toxic effects on household members (or users of public spaces).
Avoid combining disinfectants, such as bleach and ammonia, since mixtures can cause respiratory irritation and release potentially fatal gasses.
Keep children, pets and other people away during the application of the product until it is dry and there is no odor.
Open windows and use fans to ventilate. Step away from odors if they become too strong. Disinfectant solutions should always be prepared in well-ventilated areas.
Wash your hands after using any disinfectant, including surface wipes.
Keep lids tightly closed when not in use. Spills and accidents are more likely to happen when containers are open.
Do not allow children to use disinfectant wipes. Keep cleaning fluids and disinfectants out of the reach of children and pets.
Throw away disposable items like gloves and masks if they are used during cleaning. Do not clean and re-use.
Do not use disinfectant wipes to clean hands or as baby wipes.
The minimum recommended personal protective equipment when disinfecting in non-health care settings is rubber gloves, waterproof aprons and closed shoes. Eye protection and medical masks may also be needed to protect against chemicals in use or if there is a risk of splashing.
Note: Where cleaning and disinfection are not possible on a regular basis due to resource limitations, frequent hand washing and avoiding touching the face should be the primary prevention approaches to reduce any potential transmission associated with surface contamination.

76,76,"What is the guidance for the disinfection of outdoor spaces such as open markets and roads?
","In outdoor spaces, large-scale spraying or fumigation in areas such as streets or open market places for the COVID-19 virus or other pathogens is not recommended. Streets and sidewalks are not considered as routes of infection for COVID-19. Spraying disinfectants, even outdoors, can be noxious for people’s health and cause eye, respiratory or skin irritation or damage.
This practice will be ineffective since the presence of dirt or rubbish for example, inactivates the disinfectant, and manual cleaning to physically remove all matter is not feasible. This is even less effective on porous surfaces such as sidewalks and unpaved walkways. Even in the absence of dirt or rubbish, it is unlikely that chemical spraying would adequately cover surfaces allowing the required contact time to inactivate pathogens.

","No. Spraying of individuals with disinfectants (such as in a tunnel, cabinet, or chamber) is not recommended under any circumstances. This practice could be physically and psychologically harmful and would not reduce an infected person’s ability to spread the virus through droplets or contact. Even if someone who is infected with COVID-19 goes through a disinfection tunnel or chamber, as soon as they start speaking, coughing or sneezing they can still spread the virus. 
The toxic effect of spraying with chemicals such as chlorine on individuals can lead to eye and skin irritation, bronchospasm due to inhalation, and potentially gastrointestinal effects such as nausea and vomiting. In addition to health safety concerns, the use of chlorine in large-scale spraying practices may prevent this resource from being used for important interventions such as drinking water treatment and environmental disinfection of health care facilities.

Wearing gloves in public spaces does not replace the need for hand hygiene, nor does it offer any additional measure of protection against the COVID-19 virus than hand hygiene. Gloves do not provide complete protection against hand contamination, as pathogens may gain access to the hands via small defects in gloves or by contamination of the hands during glove removal.

81,81,"Do weather and climate determine where COVID-19 occurs?
","No. There is currently no conclusive evidence that either weather (short term variations in meteorological conditions) or climate (long-term averages) have a strong influence on transmission. The SARS-CoV-2 virus which causes COVID-19 disease has been transmitted in all regions of the world, from cold and dry, to hot and humid climates.
SARS-CoV-2 is thought to be mainly transmitted directly from person-to-person through close contact, or through respiratory droplets produced when an infected person coughs or sneezes. People may be infected by touching exposed surfaces, but this is not thought to be a major transmission route. While temperature and humidity may influence how long the virus survives outside of the human body, this effect is likely to be small compared to the degree of contact between people.
Physical distancing and washing hands are therefore essential to breaking the chain of transmission, and are the most effective way to protect yourself, in all locations and all seasons of the year.

82,82,Will climate change make COVID-19 worse?," 
There is no evidence of a direct connection between climate change and the emergence or transmission of COVID-19 disease. As the disease is now well established in the human population, efforts should focus on reducing transmission and treating patients.
However, climate change may indirectly affect the COVID-19 response, as it undermines environmental determinants of health, and places additional stress on health systems. More generally, most emerging infectious diseases, and almost all recent pandemics, originate in wildlife, and there is evidence that increasing human pressure on the natural environment may drive disease emergence. Strengthening health systems, improved surveillance of infectious disease in wildlife, livestock and humans, and greater protection of biodiversity and the natural environment, should reduce the risks of future outbreaks of other new diseases.

83,83,"Have measures to contain COVID-19 reduced air pollution and emissions of greenhouse gasses?
","Air pollution is a serious health risk. It kills approximately 7 million people every year and is responsible for one third of all deaths from stroke, lung cancer and heart disease. Over 90% of the global population lives in places where the WHO outdoor air quality guideline levels are not met, and about two-thirds of this exposure is caused by burning of fossil fuels, which also drives climate change.
Efforts to control COVID-19 transmission have reduced economic activity and led to temporary improvements in air quality in some areas. In contrast, as carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gasses that drive climate change persist for a long time in the atmosphere, temporary emissions reductions only have a limited effect on atmospheric concentrations. Carbon dioxide levels at observing stations around the world in the first months of 2020 have been higher than in 2019.
Environmental improvements resulting from the COVID-19 response may be reversed by a rapid expansion of polluting economic activities once the measures have ended, unless there is a clear focus to promote equity, environmental health, around a just transition to a green economy.
Any short-term environmental benefits as a result of COVID-19 come at an unacceptable human and economic cost, and are no substitute for planned and sustained action on air quality and climate.

84,84,"How does water scarcity affect infectious diseases like COVID-19?
","Access to adequate and safe water and sanitation is essential for communities to practice basic hygiene and reduce transmission of COVID-19. Access to these services in health facilities is crucial to preventing infections, reducing the spread of antimicrobial resistance and providing quality care.
One in four health care facilities around the world lacks basic water services, directly impacting over two billion people. Around 80% of the world’s population is already experiencing some level of water scarcity. Climate change further threatens the availability of water for consumption, food production, personal hygiene, and medical care, including for infectious disease.

85,85,"What can the global response to COVID-19 teach us about our response to climate change?
","The COVID-19 pandemic is a Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC), which has claimed lives, and severely disrupted communities. Climate change is a gradually increasing stress that may be the defining public health threat of the 21st century. Nonetheless, common lessons can be drawn:
Ensuring universal health coverage (UHC), through well-resourced, equitable health systems, is essential to protect the public from both short and long-term health threats.
Guaranteeing global health security requires an all-hazards approach to preparedness, from infectious disease outbreaks, to extreme weather events, to climate change.  
Ensuring access to the environmental determinants of health, such as clean air, water and sanitation, safe and nutritious food, is an essential protection against all health risks. WHO estimates that avoidable environmental risks cause about a quarter of the global health burden.
Early action saves lives. Delay in responding to clear evidence of threats, whether from pandemics, or from climate change, increases human and socioeconomic costs.
Inequality is a major barrier in ensuring health and wellbeing, especially for the most vulnerable in society. Social and economic inequality manifests in unequal health risks. When faced with public health threats of a global scale, such as COVID-19 or climate change, we are only as strong as our weakest health system.

86,86,"What is contact tracing?
","Contact tracing is the process of identifying, assessing, and managing people who have been exposed to someone who has been infected with the COVID-19 virus. Contact tracing and quarantine of contacts identified through contact tracing interrupt transmission between people and are essential public health tools for controlling the virus. Contact tracing can also help people who are at a higher risk of developing severe disease know earlier that they have been exposed so that they can  get medical care quicker if they go on to develop symptoms.

87,87,"Can contact tracing help in controlling spread of the virus?
","Yes. Contact tracing is an essential public health tool for controlling infectious disease outbreaks, such as those caused by the COVID-19 virus.

You may also be informed directly by someone you were in contact with who later tested positive. If you have downloaded a COVID-19 proximity tracing application, you may also get notified through your mobile phone.       
If you are identified as a contact, you should undertake quarantine, which means that you separate yourself from others in your household, stay there and monitor your health for any signs of illness. Some countries have set up dedicated facilities to enable contacts to complete quarantine outside their household. Contact your local health authorities to find out how you can safely quarantine.
WHO recommends that you stay in quarantine for 14 days after you were last in contact with the person infected with the COVID-19 virus, but the duration of quarantine may vary by country. Check with your local or national health authority.

","The data storage for tracing apps can either be stored and processed on a central server managed by the national public health authority, or stored and processed on the users’ phones. There is a consensus by several data protection authorities that storing data on users’ phones enhances privacy, since users have greater control over the amount of information that they share with health authorities. The collection and use of such data by health authorities can therefore be limited to what is strictly necessary for the operation of a digital tracing system.
Whichever approach is selected, governments and third parties should ensure digital tracing systems follow WHO guidance on ethical considerations on the use of digital proximity tracing for COVID-19 contact tracing. Protecting the personal data and privacy of individuals participating in digital tracing is critical to ensure the protection of human rights and civil liberties as well as the establishment of public trust.

92,92,"How do I manage quarantine and how do I take care of myself during quarantine?
","WHO recommends supported quarantine for 14 days from the last contact with a confirmed case to minimize risk of infecting others. You should remain separated from others in the household for the duration of quarantine. If you cannot be in a separate room, stay at least one meter away from others, the farther the better. Make sure you have enough food and water, and a way to communicate with others. The quarantine space should be well ventilated. You should minimize your contact with others. If you do have someone visit you during quarantine, you should both wear medical masks, keep windows open if possible and clean your hands before and after being together. Ideally, you should have only one visitor provide food and supplies during the quarantine period and this should be someone at low risk of developing severe COVID-19.
Quarantine may cause worry or anxiety, and this is normal. Thiscan also be an opportunity to take time to care for yourself. Consider reconnecting with loved ones via telephone or phone apps, watch movies or read books, exercise indoors, make crafts, or catch up on things you haven’t had time for.

93,93,"What can I do as an individual to support contact tracing measures in my community?
","Everyone has a part to play to bring COVID-19 under control, and contact tracing begins with informed, engaged and enabled communities. Understand the local public health and social measures and collaborate with health authorities for case and contact investigation. Agree to monitoring, report signs or symptoms of COVID-19 promptly, and be prepared to quarantine or go into isolation if you become a confirmed case of COVID-19.       
In addition, you can, while respecting physical distance and all other protective measures, provide support to relatives or friends who have to be isolated or undertake quarantine.

What if I’m concerned about how my private information is going to be used?","Yes, providing accurate information when requested is important to successful contact tracing activities. National authorities may ask incoming travelers to report their health status at the time of travel, possible exposures to confirmed or probable COVID-19 cases within the previous two weeks, and to provide their contact details so they can be located for health monitoring or international contact tracing purposes. Authorities may also require arriving passengers to download and use a national COVID-19 digital proximity tracing app on arrival.

95,95,"How does contact tracing work?
","Contact tracing identifies, and monitors people who have been exposed to someone who has been infected with SARS-CoV-2, and involves several steps:
Defining contacts: Contact definitions may vary by country. WHO defines a contact as a person who has been exposed to someone else who has had recent probable or confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection: 1. face-to-face contact with a probable or confirmed case within 1 meter and for at least 15 minutes; 2. direct physical contact with a probable or confirmed case; 3. direct care for a patient with probable or confirmed COVID-19 disease without the use of recommended PPE; or 4. other situations as indicated by local risk assessments. Exposure is considered any time between 2 days before to at least 13 days after the case started to show symptoms. For asymptomatic cases, a contact is anyone who has been exposed between 2 days before and 10 days after the date on which the sample that led to confirmation of infection was taken.
Identifying contacts: this is usually done through an interview with the person infected with SARS-CoV-2 to find out who they have been in contact with during the period of time described above. There are other ways to identify contacts depending on the setting, for example through membership or attendance lists of places the case visited during the period described above, or through public notices. Digital proximity tracing applications have also been developed to help identify and notify contacts through automated processes.
Informing contacts: each identified contact should be contacted to confirm whether they meet the definition of a contact. This may be done through health authorities and/or via digital tracing proximity applications. Cases may also be encouraged to inform their own contacts. Each person identified as a contact will be informed about the goal of contact tracing, the process (including how their personal data will be protected), how to undertake quarantine and for how long, and who to contact with any concerns or questions. Additional information should be provided on symptoms to monitor throughout the quarantine period, and what to do if a contact returns a positive test or becomes unwell.
Managing and monitoring contacts: contacts should be encouraged and supported during the  quarantine period. WHO recommends that the quarantine period ends 14 days after the contact was last exposed to the person who has been infected with SARS-CoV-2. However, the duration of the quarantine period may vary between countries.
Data processes and analysis: The information collected from each contact is stored in a secure database. These processes vary from country to country.

96,96,"Who is defined as a contact?
","A contact is currently defined as anyone who had direct contact with, or was within 1 meter for at least 15 minutes, with a person who may be infected or is infected with SARS-CoV-2 while they were infectious or potentially infectious, even if the person with the infection did not have symptoms. National and local public health authorities may have additional considerations to define contacts according to local risk assessments.
Contacts should be supported to quarantine to limit the possibility of exposing other people to infection, if they become ill.

97,97,"What is backward contact tracing?
","Backward contact tracing refers to the process of trying to understand how the case became infected, also known as case or source investigation. While traditional contact tracing identifies people who were exposed to cases and may become cases themselves, backward contact tracing or source investigation looks back in time to identify settings or events where exposure to the virus may have occurred. This may help public health authorities identify more cases (such as at an event or setting where the case may have been infected) and identify settings that have led to infection. This can inform the development of targeted public health and social measures to reduce the overall number of cases.

98,98,"When should contact tracing be implemented?
","Comprehensive contact tracing should be implemented each time cases or clusters (groups of linked cases) are identified. During intense transmission, contact tracing capacities may be overwhelmed, so contact tracing     activities may  focus on household contacts, healthcare workers contacts, contacts in high-risk closed settings (such as dormitories, institutions, long-term living facilities),and contacts at higher risk of developing severe COVID-19.
It is important to maintain contact tracing and quarantine of contacts even when the number of new cases may be decreasing, and/or public health and social measures may be being relaxed, in order to ensure that transmission continues to reduce.

99,99,"How do you form a contact tracing workforce?
","A contact tracing workforce can be drawn from many settings, including individuals connected with local government, civil society, non-governmental organizations, universities and community volunteers. Ideally, a gender-balanced contact tracing team should be recruited from the community and have general literacy, strong communication skills, local language proficiency and an understanding of the local context and culture.
They should be provided with adequate training to ensure efficiency, accuracy and good communication skills when implementing case and contact investigations, and integrated within the wider COVID-19 response team.
Several training materials have been developed by WHO and partners and may be adapted to local needs. Many are available through the Global Outbreak Alert and Response Network (GOARN) knowledge platform, and OpenWHO. Training should include the basics of virus transmission, prevention and control measures; how to monitor signs and symptoms; and standard operating procedures for contact tracing, including interview tips and ethics of public health surveillance and quarantine. Contact tracers should also be briefed on their rights, roles and responsibilities, including for occupational safety and health.
It is important for public health authorities to train the contact tracing workforce when there is no or low transmission, and anticipate ways to be able to scale the size of the trained contact tracing workforce, if transmission increases.

100,100,"What are some of the challenges to effective contact tracing for COVID-19?
","Some of the challenges are the availability of a trained contact tracing workforce, availability of resources for contact tracing and community engagement.
Another main challenge is the intensity of the COVID-19 transmission. In situations of intense transmission, public health resources can quickly become overwhelmed and often cannot cope with the workload of identifying contacts and monitoring them. In such situations, WHO recommends focusing on the contacts with highest exposure and those most at risk of developing severe disease.

101,101,"What are some digital tools used to support contact tracing? How can they enhance contact tracing processes?
","Classic interview-based contact tracing relies heavily on the presence of a trained workforce to carry out the essential activities such as contact elicitation, notification and follow-up. However, this workforce can be quickly overwhelmed in the context of widespread SARS-CoV-2 transmission.
Electronic tools and information technology have been used to enhance the efficiency of contact tracing processes, and are currently being used in the COVID-19 pandemic.  So far, no single digital tool addresses all the steps required to monitor end-to-end contact tracing and quarantine of contacts. Oversight from the public health workforce is still required. The technical and ethical requirements related to the use of such digital tools should be considered  when making decisions as to the use of these tools. Digital tools that support contact tracing processes may be broadly divided into three categories based on their public health function during specific steps of the contact tracing process:
Identifying and notifying contacts: These solutions are intended for use by the general public, health professionals and the contact tracing team. They include digital proximity tracing tools that use systems based on Bluetooth or GPS location signaling, to notify users who have been in close proximity and prolonged contact to individuals who tested positive for COVID-19 and registered their status in the tool. There are also location-based digital contract tracing tools that use quick response (QR) codes that can be scanned by smartphones users when they visit a venue, so that if they later test positive for COVID-19, other application users who attended the same venue, at the same time may be sent an alert, if local public health authorities deem it necessary.
Monitoring contacts: These tools are intended for use by those identified as contacts, health professionals and the contact tracing team. They include symptom checker tools that can help contacts  to self-monitor and report the presence or absence of symptoms to health professionals who may conduct further assessments, health counseling and connect them with the public health authorities for testing and other supportive services. These tools may be particularly helpful in settings where contact tracing workforce personnel may be limited and/or there are physical or security barriers preventing in-person visits by contact tracing teams.
Surveillance data management and analysis:  These solutions are used by public health professionals to collect, manage, analyze and visualize data collected by contact tracing teams which link cases and contacts. They include outbreak response tools (such as Go.Data, Commcare, SORMAS, etc.) that can be used for case investigation, listing and monitoring of contacts, and analysis.
It is important to note that these tools cannot substitute a well-trained health and community workforce, qualified supervisors, decentralized operations and good coordination; which are all necessary criteria for successful and effective contract tracing.

102,102,"What should be considered for data protection?
","The ethics of public health information, data protection, and data privacy must be considered at all levels of contact tracing activities, including training and use of tools. In particular:
Safeguards must be in place to guarantee privacy and data protection in accordance with the legal frameworks of the countries where systems are implemented.
Everyone involved in contact tracing must adhere to the ethical principles of handling personal information, to ensure responsible data management and respect for privacy throughout the process.
How data will be handled, stored, and used needs to be communicated to those concerned in a clear and transparent manner. This is important for buy-in and engagement as well as to avoid misperceptions that could jeopardize the effectiveness of a contact tracing programme.
Digital tools used for contact tracing should be assessed before use to ensure safeguarding data protection according to national regulations.

There is a wide variety of modern methods, one of which may suit you best. Condoms, when they are used consistently and correctly, are the only method of contraception that help to prevent unintended pregnancy and protect against sexually transmitted infections, including HIV.  They can be used together with other methods of contraception to protect against both unintended pregnancy and sexually transmitted infections.

109,109,"Why is providing contraception/ family planning, as well as family planning services and information, important during the COVID-19 pandemic?
","Contraception and family planning information and services are life-saving and important at all times. Sexual activity does not cease with the COVID-19 pandemic, it is therefore crucial to ensure that people are able to access rights-based services and information to initiate and / or continue use of contraception.
By preventing unintended pregnancies, contraception helps to protect girls and women from the negative health consequences of unintended pregnancies, which can save their lives. Contraception reduces the need for abortion, meaning that women and girls are less at risk of unsafe abortion, which again can be lifesaving.
Condoms, when used consistently and correctly, help to prevent both unintended pregnancies and sexually transmitted infections (including HIV).
In addition, by preventing the negative health consequences associated with unintended pregnancies, unsafe abortion and sexually transmitted infections (including HIV), contraception can help alleviate unnecessary additional pressure on already-stretched health systems which are working hard to address COVID-19.

112,112,"I am a healthcare provider. I have heard that persons with COVID-19 may have increased risk of blood clots. How should I advise individuals who are using or want to use combined hormonal contraception?
","According to currently available evidence, most women of childbearing age with COVID-19 will likely be asymptomatic or have mild COVID-19 symptoms and should continue to take combined hormonal contraception (CHC). Here are the most common possible scenarios: 
Women who are asymptomatic or with mild symptoms of known COVID-19: combined hormonal contraception can be continued and is considered safe in this population. If women are concerned, their provider should explain that there is no evidence of increased risk of thrombosis among combined hormonal contraception users with mild COVID-19 symptoms. If a combined hormonal contraception user wishes to discontinue this method, she can be offered a progestin-only or non-hormonal method, if available and acceptable.
Women with serious symptoms(difficulty breathing or shortness of breath, chest pain or pressure, or loss of speech or movement) of COVID-19 who are not hospitalized: Discontinuation of combined hormonal contraception should be considered, based on a patient’s clinical symptoms of COVID-19 (e.g. immobilization for more than 7 days, difficulty breathing or shortness of breath, pneumonia). Considerations around stopping combined hormonal contraception should also take into account if the user has other medical conditions that may increase the risk of thrombosis during COVID-19. If combined hormonal contraception is discontinued, progestin-only or non-hormonal methods can be offered, if available and acceptable.
Women hospitalized with severe COVID-19: Combined hormonal contraception should be discontinued during hospitalization. The risk of thrombosis in this acutely ill population may outweigh the benefits of continuing combined hormonal contraception. Progestin-only and non-hormonal contraceptive methods can be used.
Women resuming contraception: It is important that all women who discontinue contraception during COVID-19 illness are given counseling about when to resume contraception and are provided with the method of their choice. Any new or existing medical conditions need to be considered when choosing a contraceptive method. Combined hormonal contraception can be resumed 2 weeks after any prolonged period of prolonged limited mobility (immobilization). the end of immobilization.

Dexamethasone is generally safe. It presents a favorable benefit-risk profile, particularly in patients with severe forms of pneumonia, while the benefit is less prominent in patients with non-severe pneumonia. As the treatment is short, even at high doses, corticosteroids are not associated with serious side effects. Potentially higher blood glucose levels (hyperglycaemia) are temporary.
Prolonged use (I.e., used for more than two weeks) may be associated with adverse events such as glaucoma, cataract, fluid retention, hypertension, psychological effects (e.g., mood swings, memory issues, confusion or irritation), weight gain, or increased risk of infections and osteoporosis.

early warning for COVID-19 cases in a community;
detection of COVID-19 in locations with weak clinical surveillance;
monitoring circulation of the virus during outbreaks; or
to trigger case-finding in locations where there are or may be suspected cases, such as quarantine hotels, university campuses or prisons.

Finding this RNA in wastewater means that one or more people in the community likely excreted the virus through urine, feces or by coughing or sneezing. The RNA suggests that the virus was in the community at the time it was excreted. However, the wastewater test does not identify who was or is infected or indicate if the persons excreting the virus are still infectious to others.

It remains important to protect yourself with personal protective equipment whenever contact with bodily fluids may occur and to clean your hands frequently.

Natural bodies of water and swimming pools do not appear to pose a risk for COVID-19 transmission even if polluted by feces or wastewater. Pools are usually treated regularly to prevent contamination with a range of pathogens which could be present.
However, crowded beaches or swimming pools do pose a risk of spreading COVID-19 through close contact with infected people or contaminated surfaces. To reduce the risk of this transmission, clean hands frequently, stay at least 1 meter away from others in and out of the water, and wear a mask when this distancing is not possible.

138,138,"Can I adapt previous frameworks for pandemic influenza to guide resource allocation for COVID-19?
","Many ethical frameworks have been produced for resource allocation, some of which have been included in pandemic plans. Those frameworks provide useful guidance in the current scenario. Yet, when applying them, we must take into account the type of health care resource, the context, and the stage of the pandemic. That is, while the ethical principles that apply to resource allocation might be the same in different pandemics, they can lead to different decisions, given contextual circumstances. For example, this pandemic appears to significantly impact older adults (those 60 years of age or older), and such characteristics are relevant to shaping priorities for the allocation of resources during COVID-19. As a result, it may be inappropriate to use critical care triage guidelines that have age cut-offs that deprioritize or exclude those aged over 60 years.
When applying ethical guidelines for resource allocation, we should consider the extent to which resources are overwhelmed in the current context. It would be inappropriate, for instance, to exclude population groups from being allocated a resource (for example, ventilators) at the outset of a pandemic when capacity remains. When resources are scarce, though – when there is an insufficient supply to meet everyone’s needs – resource allocation should be guided by well established, broadly applicable ethical principles, unless there are characteristics of the outbreak that justify different courses of action. Irrelevant characteristics of populations within countries, such as ethnicity, race or creed, should play no role in any resource allocation in any pandemic. This reflects our commitment to treating people with equal respect.

139,139,"Are the ethical considerations the same for all medical countermeasures, including therapeutics, vaccines and personal protective equipment (PPE)?","Generally, the considerations may be different. The allocation of different resources may find ethical justifications in different principles or values. For instance, once a novel vaccine is found to be safe and effective, to prioritize those at highest risk, as well as populations like health care workers who may be more likely to serve as vectors for transmission, is justified.
Within those subgroups, some suggest that a lottery-based (i.e., random) allocation may be justified, given that resources will be limited and we can assume nearly equal benefits will be derived from any recipient within that group. This is not the case, however, for other resources such as ventilators, where some individuals may derive significantly more benefit than others.

140,140,"How should decision-makers make considered ethical judgements about these matters, given the likelihood that there will not be enough of a resource? Who should be involved in decision-making on scarce resources?","For most decisions, multiple ethical values and principles will be relevant to deliberations about how to allocate resources. This is likely to generate some disagreement, because different people may weigh the values differently. Some may prioritize equality while others might put more emphasis on best outcomes or prioritization of the worst-off. For this reason, it is imperative that the different values be weighed and applied to specific allocation issues using a fair process.
A fair process for allocating scarce resources must promote certain ethical values:
Transparency. In a transparent process, the decisions and their justifications should be made public. This means that the population should be informed about the criteria guiding the decisions.
Inclusiveness. Those affected by allocation decisions – including individuals, communities or countries – should be able to exert at least some influence over the decision-making process as well as the decision itself. This also means that decisions 4 should be open to challenge and potentially reversible, perhaps through an appeal process.
Consistency. Decisions should be consistent so that all persons in the same categories are treated in the same way. This means that favoritism towards one’s own family, religious or political compatriots, or otherwise, is not appropriate. All forms of corruption that are at variance with this principle should be challenged and condemned.
Accountability. Those making decisions about allocation must be accountable for those decisions – that is, they should justify their decisions and be held responsible for them. A fair process means that allocation decisions should not be made by individuals, by individual pharmaceutical companies, or, in the case of allocation between countries, by a single country. Resources such as vaccines and therapies should not be stockpiled outside the system of fair allocation.
The fair allocation of resources is one that is valuable in itself precisely because it is fair. However, it may also be valuable because a fair system engenders solidarity and trust, which are vital to the successful and sustained collective response necessary for dealing effectively with any outbreak.

141,141,What conclusions can we draw about the fair allocation of scarce resources within countries during the COVID-19 outbreak?,"Health care workers (caring for patients) and first responders can justifiably be prioritized when allocating some resources because of their contribution to the health and well-being of the community. Their health helps preserve the health of others.
Participants of research aimed at developing vaccines, therapies or other critical resources should receive some priority in receiving those resources because they have also helped save others by their participation. This is not an absolute priority – for example, it should not take precedence over giving priority to those most at risk in the case of resources such as vaccines.
While the principle of first come, first served is often applied when allocating resources in health care settings, it is rarely appropriate in an emergency. In practice, it is very likely to favor certain groups, such as those closest to a distribution center, those with access to better information, or those who are most well-off.
Younger populations appear to be at lower risk in the COVID-19 context. Consequently, the principle of youngest first should have low priority for vaccines, but perhaps may have more weight if they do become sick and need critical care resources.
The allocation of different resources may find ethical justification in different principles or values. For instance, if a novel vaccine is found to be safe and effective, a lottery-based allocation may be justified among those at highest risk, the old and those with comorbidities, if they outnumber available vaccines.
Maximizing utility should be balanced with the principle of priority to the worst-off: centralizing the availability of resources in larger centers may extend their benefits to more people, but may exclude isolated populations and challenge our concern for those at highest risk.

143,143,"Should grocery store workers wear gloves? Masks?
","Disposable Gloves
Gloves may be used by food workers but must be changed frequently and hands must be washed between glove changes and when gloves are removed. Gloves must be changed after carrying out non-food related activities such as opening/closing doors by hand, and emptying bins. Food workers should be aware that wearing gloves can allow bacteria to build up on the surface of the hands, so hand washing is extremely important when gloves are removed to avoid subsequent contamination of food. Food workers should not touch their mouth, nose and eyes when wearing gloves.
Disposable gloves can give a false sense of safety and should not be used in the food work environment as a substitute for hand washing. The COVID-19 virus can contaminate disposable gloves in the same way it can get onto workers hands and contact surfaces. Removal of disposable gloves can lead to contamination of hands. Wearing disposable gloves can give you a false sense of security and may result in staff not washing hands as frequently as required.
Handwashing is a greater protective barrier to infection than wearing of disposable gloves. Food businesses need to ensure adequate sanitary facilities are provided and ensure food workers thoroughly and frequently wash their hands. Soap and water is adequate for hand washing. Hand sanitisers can be used as an additional measure but should not replace hand washing.
Wearing of Face Masks
WHO advice on the use of masks in the context of COVID-19 should be followed. Face Masks do not have to be routinely used by food workers to protect against transmission of COVID-19. However, for some food processing activities, such as working in abattoirs or handling cooked, ready-to-eat foods, wearing face masks is a usual practice.
WHO recommends that face masks should be used if a person is sick with symptoms of COVID-19 (especially coughing) or looking after someone with suspected or confirmed COVID-19.
However, a food worker who is sick or who has symptoms of COVID-19 should not be allowed to work in grocery stores or other food businesses and should be excluded from work until free of symptoms or deemed fit for work by a medical doctor.

144,144,"What is the protocol when an employee working in a food business becomes ill with COVID-19?
","Staff who are feeling unwell should not report to work and should seek medical advice. However, in the event that a food worker becomes unwell in the workplace with typical symptoms of COVID-19, they should be removed to an area away from other people. If possible, find a room or area where they can be isolated behind a closed door, such as a staff office. If it is possible to open a window, do so for ventilation. Arrangements should be made for the unwell employee to be removed quickly from the food premise.
The employee who is unwell should follow national guidelines for reporting cases/suspect cases of COVID-19. Whilst they wait for medical advice or to be sent home, they should avoid any contact with other employees. They should avoid touching people, surfaces and objects and be advised to cover their mouth and nose with disposable tissue when they cough or sneeze and put the tissue in a bag or pocket and then dispose of the tissue in a bin. If they do not have any tissues available, they should cough and sneeze into the crook of their elbow. If they need to go to the bathroom whilst waiting for medical assistance, they should use a separate bathroom, if available.
All surfaces that the infected employee has come into contact with must be cleaned. Alcohol based sanitizers/surface disinfectants should be used for cleaning purposes. In general, alcohol-based disinfectants (ethanol, propan-2-ol, propan-1-ol) have been shown to significantly reduce infectivity of enveloped viruses like COVID-19 virus, in concentrations of 70-80%. Common disinfectants with active ingredients based on quaternary ammonium compounds (QUATS) and chlorine would also have virucidal properties. All staff should wash their hands thoroughly for 20 seconds with soap and water after any contact with someone who is unwell with symptoms consistent with coronavirus infection.
If an employee is confirmed as a case of COVID-19 it will be necessary to notify all close contacts of the infected employee so they too can take measures to minimize further risk of spread. Examples of contacts in the food businesses could include any employee who was in face-to-face or physical (i.e., touching) contact; any employee who was within 1 meter with the confirmed case; anyone who has cleaned up any bodily fluids without adequate PPE (e.g. gloves, overalls, protective clothing); employees in the same working team or workgroup as the confirmed case, and any employee living in the same household as a confirmed case.
WHO recommends that contacts be quarantined for 14 days from the last point of exposure to the confirmed case.22 At a minimum, staff who have had close contact with the infected employee should be asked to stay at home for 14 days from the last time they had contact with the confirmed case and practice physical distancing. If they become unwell at any time within their 14-day isolation period and they test positive for COVID-19, they will become a confirmed case, and should be managed as such.
Staff who have not had close contact with the original confirmed case should continue taking the usual precautions and attend work as usual. Organizing employees into small teams or workgroups will help to minimize disruption to work processes in the event of an employee reporting sick with symptoms of COVID-19. Closure of the workplace is not recommended.

145,145,"When can an employee return to work following illness? Are temperature checks appropriate?
","A return to work policy for staff who have been infected and recovered from COVID-19 should be in place. WHO recommends that a confirmed patient could be released from isolation once their symptoms resolve and they have two negative PCR tests at least 24 hours apart.  If testing is not possible, WHO recommends that a confirmed patient can be released from isolation 14 days after symptoms resolve. 
Taking the temperature of food workers is not recommended. Fever is only one of the symptoms of COVID-19 and absence of fever alone is not a reliable indicator of wellness. As part of a food business ‘fitness to work’ guidelines, staff should report to management if they are sick with typical COVID-19 symptoms, particularly fever.

Frequent hand washing with soap and water and use of hand sanitizers are also important in reducing the risk of transmission. All food businesses should follow the physical distancing and hand washing guidance of WHO.
The Codex Alimentarius Commission has adopted several practical guidelines on how to apply and implement best practices to ensure food hygiene (Codex General Principles of Food Hygiene, CXC 1- 1969), handle meats (Codex Code of Hygienic Practice for Meat, CXC 58 – 2005), and control viruses in foods (Guidelines for the Application of General Principles of Food Hygiene to the Control of Viruses in Food (CAC/GL 79-2012). Enhanced food safety practices at this time, such as those recommended in the Codex documents mentioned, will reduce the likelihood of contamination of foods with any pathogen and help lower the public health burden caused by already established foodborne infections, reducing the stress on an already overburdened public health system.

147,147,"How should employees maintain safe distance from one another during food production and processing?
","WHO guidelines are to maintain at least 1 meter (3 feet) between fellow workers. Where the food production environment makes it difficult to do so, employers need to consider what measures to put in place to protect employees. Examples of practical measures to adhere to physical distancing guidance in the food processing environment are to:
stagger workstations on either side of processing lines so that food workers are not facing one another,
provide personal protection equipment (PPE) such as face masks, hair nets, disposable gloves, clean overalls and slip reduction work shoes for staff. The use of PPE would be routine in high risk areas of food premises that produce ready-to-eat and cooked foods. When staff are dressed in PPE it is possible to reduce distance between workers,
space out workstations, which may require reduction in the speed of production lines,
limit the number of staff in a food preparation area at any one time,
organize staff into working groups or teams to facilitate reduced interaction between groups, including during change of work shifts.

148,148,"How should baked goods and fresh produce be displayed in a food market/grocery store?
","It is important to maintain good hygiene practices around open food displays, with ready-to-eat food products such as salad bars, fresh produce displays and bakery products. Consumers should always be advised to wash fruits and vegetables with potable water prior to consumption. Both customers and staff should strictly observe good personal hygiene practices at all times around open food areas.
In order to hygienically manage open food displays and to avoid the transmission of COVID-19 through surface contact, food retailers should:
Maintain frequent washing and sanitizing of all food contact surfaces and utensils;
Require food service workers to frequently wash hands, and, if using gloves, these must be changed;
Require food service workers to frequently clean and sanitize counters, serving utensils and condiment containers;
Make available hand sanitiser for consumers on their way in and out of the food premises;
Should consider not openly displaying or selling unwrapped bakery products from self-service counters. Bakery products on open, self-service displays in retail stores should be placed in plastic/cellophane or paper packaging. Where loose bakery products are displayed in retail stores, these should be placed in plexiglass display cabinets and placed in bags using tongs when customers are served.
Ready-to-eat salads available in retail for self-serve, should also be placed behind plexiglass display cabinets and serving utensils should be frequently sanitized.

152,152,"What is known about various conditions affecting survivability of the virus?
","Very little is known about how the SARS-CoV-2 virus survives outside the human body. Probably the most up-to-date summary of scientific information we have on survival in the environment is from the European Center for Disease control (ECDC) and the following is extracted from their recent technical report:
Recent publications have evaluated the survival of SARS-CoV-2 on different surfaces. According to van Doremalen et al., the environmental stability of SARS-CoV-2 is up to three hours in the air post-aerosolization, up to four hours on copper, up to 24 hours on cardboard and up to two to three days on plastic and stainless steel, albeit with significantly decreased titres [3]. These findings are comparable with results obtained for environmental stability of SARS-CoV-1. These findings resulted from experiments in a controlled environment and should be interpreted with caution in the real-life environment. Moreover, different levels of environmental contamination have been detected in rooms of COVID-19 patients, ranging from 1 out of 13 to 13 out of 15 samples testing positive for SARS-CoV-2 before cleaning. No air samples were positive in these studies, but one sample from an air exhaust outlet was positive indicating that virus particles may be displaced by air and deposited on surfaces [4,5]. In a study of environmental contamination in a Chinese hospital during the COVID-19 outbreak, SARS-CoV-2 was detected in environmental samples from the COVID-19 dedicated intensive care units (ICU), the COVID-19 dedicated obstetric isolation ward and the COVID-19 dedicated isolation ward. SARS-CoV-2 was also detected on objects such as the self-service printers used by patients to self-print the results of their exams, desktop keyboards and doorknobs. Virus was detected most commonly on gloves (15.4% of samples) and rarely on eye protection (1.7%) [6]. This evidence shows the presence of SARS-CoV-2 in the environment of a COVID-19 patient, therefore reinforcing the belief that fomites play a role in transmission of SARS-CoV-2; however, the relative importance of this route of transmission compared to direct exposure to respiratory droplets is still unclear.

All surfaces that the infected employee has come into contact with must be cleaned, including all surfaces and objects which are visibly contaminated with body fluids/respiratory secretions, and all potentially contaminated high-contact areas such as toilets, door handles, telephones. Alcohol based sanitizers/surface disinfectants should be used for cleaning purposes.

188,188,How can people assess the risk for exposure to COVID-19 in their workplace and plan for preventive measures?,"Managers with the support of an occupational health and safety advisor should carry out rapid risk assessments to determine the possibility of exposure risk in order to put in place preventive measures. This should be done for each specific work setting and each job.
Low exposure risk
Jobs or work without frequent, close contact with the general public or others. Workers in this group have minimal occupational contact with the public and other co-workers. Examples of such jobs may include remote workers (i.e., working from home), office workers without frequent close contact with others and workers providing teleservices.
Medium exposure risk
Jobs or tasks with close, frequent contact with the general public or others. This risk level may apply to workers who have frequent and close contact with the people in high-population-density work environments (e.g. food markets, bus stations, public transport, and other work activities where physical distancing of at least 1 meter may be difficult to observe), or tasks that require close and frequent contact between co-workers. This may also include frequent contact with people returning from areas with community transmission. Examples of such jobs may include frontline workers in retail, home deliveries, accommodation, construction, police and security, public transport, and water and sanitation.
High exposure risk
Jobs or tasks with close contact with people who may be more likely to have COVID-19, as well as contact with objects and surfaces possibly contaminated with the virus. Examples include transporting people known or suspected to have COVID-19 without separation between the driver and the passenger, providing domestic services or home care for people with COVID-19, and having contact with the deceased who were known or suspected of having COVID-19 at the time of their death. Jobs that may fall under this category include domestic workers, social care workers, personal transport  and home delivery providers and home repair technicians (plumbers, electricians) who have to provide services in the homes of people with COVID-19.

Clear policies and messages, training, and education for staff and managers to increase awareness of COVID-19 are essential. The management of people with COVID-19 or their contacts is also critical e.g. requiring workers who are unwell or who develop symptoms to stay at home, self isolate and contact a medical professional or the local COVID-19 information line for advice on testing and referral.

193,193,"What additional measures should be taken at workplaces and for jobs at medium risk?
","Workplaces for jobs at medium risk require daily cleaning and disinfection at least two times a day of objects and surfaces that are touched regularly, including all shared rooms, surfaces, floors, bathrooms, and changing rooms. Consider suspending any activity where physical distancing of at least 1 meter cannot be implemented in full. If this is not possible, increase ventilation, implement enhanced regular hand hygiene, and require staff to wear appropriate face masks, goggles, gloves and work clothes during cleaning procedures that generate splashes, providing training on their use. Organize changing and washing of work clothes at the workplace, so that workers can take them home.

195,195,"What should be taken into consideration when setting a physical distance at the workplace?
","WHO recommends keeping a physical distance of at least 1 meter between each person in all settings, including in workplaces. Because transmission can occur in crowded workplaces, WHO recommends providing sufficient space, at least 10 square meters, for every worker. National recommendations for physical distancing may require greater physical distance and should be complied with.
In order to support compliance with national or local recommendations, implement physical distance guidelines in a way that is practical and feasible in the context of work tasks, and which is acceptable to both workers and employers. Stimulate workers to comply with physical distancing norms also at events outside the workplace, in the community, and in dormitories.
Risk assessment and consultation between employers and workers is very important for setting up and implementing physical distancing measures at the workplace. This may require modification of workstations, changing the use of common spaces and transport vehicles, staggered work shifts, split teams and other measures to reduce social mixing at the workplace.
If physical distancing measures at the workplace are not feasible for specific work tasks, consider whether the work can be suspended, and if this is not possible, apply additional protective measures, such as the use of screens, sneeze guards,  face masks, enhanced hand hygiene, ventilation and disinfection.
Physical distancing alone can’t prevent COVID-19 transmission, it is important that it is combined with other public health measures, such as hand and respiratory hygiene, environmental clean-up and disinfection of commonly touched surfaces and objects, ventilation, wearing face masks and a policy of staying at home if unwell.

Cooperation between management and workers and their representatives is essential for workplace‐related prevention measures. International labor standards on the rights and responsibilities of workers and employers in occupational safety and health should be fully respected.
Employers, in consultation with workers and their representatives, should plan and implement measures to prevent and mitigate COVID-19 at the workplace through engineering and administrative controls, and provide personal protective equipment and clothing according to the risk assessment. Such measures should not involve any expenditure on the part of the workers.
Special measures are needed to protect workers at higher risk of developing severe disease, such as those aged 60 and over, or with underlying medical conditions, upon recommendation of the occupational health services. Workers in the informal economy and digital labor platforms, those in small enterprises, domestic and migrant workers should not be left behind in the protection of their health and safety at work and their livelihood.  
There should be no social stigma or discrimination at the workplace for any reason, including access to information and protection from COVID-19, occupational health services and mental health and psychosocial support.
If COVID-19 is contracted through occupational exposure, it could be considered an occupational disease and, if so determined, should be reported and compensated according to the international labor standards and the national schemes for employment injury benefits.

200,200,"Does WHO recommend thermal testing of people entering a workplace?
","Temperature screening cannot detect all cases of COVID-19, since infected individuals may not have fever early in the course of infection or illness, such as during the incubation period or just before other symptoms begin, even though they may already be infectious. Some people may reduce fever with a fever-reducing medication if they are concerned about the possible consequences of not coming to work. Relying on temperature screening alone will not stop the spread of COVID-19 at work.
Thermal screening at the workplace can be considered part of a package of measures to prevent and control COVID-19 at the workplace. Workers should be encouraged to self-monitor their health, possibly with the use of questionnaires, and take their own temperature regularly at home. Workplaces should adopt “stay at home if unwell” and flexible sick leave policies to discourage workers with symptoms consistent with COVID-19 from coming to the workplaces.

","Wearing masks depends on the risk assessment. For jobs and tasks that carry a medium or high risk, for people aged 60 and older, and for those with underlying health conditions, a medical mask and other personal protective equipment should be provided. Fabric masks or face coverings are currently recommended for younger people and those with no symptoms where physical distancing is not achievable. This prevents the spread of virus from the wearer (who could have COVID-19 but no symptoms) to others. The policy on wearing a mask or face covering in low risk workplaces should be in line with national or local guidelines. Masks may carry some risks if not used properly.

204,204,"What is ‘herd immunity’?
","Herd immunity', also known as 'population immunity', is the indirect protection from an infectious disease that happens when a population is immune either through vaccination or immunity developed through previous infection. WHO supports achieving 'herd immunity' through vaccination, not by allowing a disease to spread through any segment of the population, as this would result in unnecessary cases and deaths.
Herd immunity against COVID-19 should be achieved by protecting people through vaccination, not by exposing them to the pathogen that causes the disease. Read the Director-General’s 12 October media briefing speech for more detail. 
Vaccines train our immune systems to create proteins that fight disease, known as ‘antibodies’, just as would happen when we are exposed to a disease but – crucially – vaccines work without making us sick. Vaccinated people are protected from getting the disease in question and passing on the pathogen, breaking any chains of transmission. Visit our webpage on COVID-19 and vaccines for more detail. 
To safely achieve herd immunity against COVID-19, a substantial proportion of a population would need to be vaccinated, lowering the overall amount of virus able to spread in the whole population. One of the aims of working towards herd immunity is to keep vulnerable groups who cannot get vaccinated (e.g. due to health conditions like allergic reactions to the vaccine) safe and protected from the disease. Read our Q&A on vaccines and immunization for more information.
The percentage of people who need to be immune in order to achieve herd immunity varies with each disease. For example, herd immunity against measles requires about 95% of a population to be vaccinated. The remaining 5% will be protected by the fact that measles will not spread among those who are vaccinated. For polio, the threshold is about 80%. The proportion of the population that must be vaccinated against COVID-19 to begin inducing herd immunity is not known. This is an important area of research and will likely vary according to the community, the vaccine, the populations prioritized for vaccination, and other factors.  
Achieving herd immunity with safe and effective vaccines makes diseases rarer and saves lives.

205,205,"What is WHO’s position on ‘herd immunity’ as a way of fighting COVID-19?
","Attempts to reach ‘herd immunity’ through exposing people to a virus are scientifically problematic and unethical. Letting COVID-19 spread through populations, of any age or health status will lead to unnecessary infections, suffering and death.
The vast majority of people in most countries remain susceptible to this virus. Seroprevalence surveys suggest that in most countries, less than 10% of the population have been infected with COVID-19.
We are still learning about immunity to COVID-19. Most people who are infected with COVID-19 develop an immune response within the first few weeks, but we don’t know how strong or lasting that immune response is, or how it differs for different people. There have also been reports of people infected with COVID-19 for a second time.         
Until we better understand COVID-19 immunity, it will not be possible to know how much of a population is immune and how long that immunity lasts for, let alone make future predictions. These challenges should preclude any plans that try to increase immunity within a population by allowing people to get infected.
Although older people and those with underlying conditions are most at risk of severe disease and death, they are not the only ones at risk.
Finally, while most infected people get mild or moderate forms of COVID-19 and some experience no disease, many become seriously ill and must be admitted into hospital. We are only beginning to understand the long-term health impacts among people who have had COVID-19, including what is being described as ‘Long COVID.’ WHO is working with clinicians and patient groups to better understand the long term effects of COVID-19.

206,206,"What do we know about immunity from COVID-19?
","Most people who are infected with COVID-19 develop an immune response within the first few weeks after infection.
Research is still ongoing into how strong that protection is and how long it lasts. WHO is also looking into whether the strength and length of immune response depends on the type of infection a person has: without symptoms (‘asymptomatic’), mild or severe. Even people without symptoms seem to develop an immune response.
Globally, data from seroprevalence studies suggests that less than 10% of those studied have been infected, meaning that the vast majority of the world’s population remains susceptible to this virus.
For other coronaviruses – such as the common cold, SARS-CoV-1 and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) – immunity declines over time, as is the case with other diseases. While people infected with the SARS-CoV-2 virus develop antibodies and immunity, we do not yet know how long it lasts.

207,207,"What is WHO’s position on ‘lockdowns’ as a way of fighting COVID-19?
","Large scale physical distancing measures and movement restrictions, often referred to as ‘lockdowns’, can slow COVID‑19 transmission by limiting contact between people.
However, these measures can have a profound negative impact on individuals, communities, and societies by bringing social and economic life to a near stop. Such measures disproportionately affect disadvantaged groups, including people in poverty, migrants, internally displaced people and refugees, who most often live in overcrowded and under-resourced settings, and depend on daily labor for subsistence.
WHO recognizes that at certain points, some countries have had no choice but to issue stay-at-home orders and other measures, to buy time.
Governments must make the most of the extra time granted by ‘lockdown’ measures by doing all they can to build their capacities to detect, isolate, test and care for all cases; trace and quarantine all contacts; engage, empower and enable populations to drive the societal response and more.
WHO is hopeful that countries will use targeted interventions where and when needed, based on the local situation.

208,208,"Are people living with HIV at increased risk of being infected with the virus that causes COVID-19?
","People living with HIV (PLHIV) who are not taking antiretroviral treatment (ART) and have a low CD4 cell count, particularly those with advanced HIV disease, are at increased risk of opportunistic infections and AIDS related complications. However, there is evolving and conflicting evidence whether people living with HIV have an increased risk of acquisition of SARS-CoV-2 infection and/or COVID-19 clinical complications in PLHIV compared to the general population.
PLHIV can have a greater prevalence of the known risk factors for COVID-19 acquisition and complications, such as heart disease, kidney disease, diabetes, chronic pulmonary disease, obesity, as well as, other comorbidities and co-infections, like tuberculosis. 
Several case report series and small cohort studies among hospitalized PLHIV with COVID-19 have shown comparable clinical outcomes and similar risk of SARS CoV2 infection when compared with general population, particularly in those with well controlled HIV infection (on ART and with a CD4 count > 200 cells/mm3 and suppressed viral load). These limited clinical data suggest the mortality risk in PLHIV is associated with known COVID-19 factors such as older age and presence of comorbidities including cardiovascular disease, diabetes, chronic respiratory disease and obesity .
There have been several systematic and non-systematic reviews that evaluated COVID-19 outcomes among PLHIV; most have found comparable outcomes of mortality and morbidity when compared with HIV negative patients . Methods did not always include assessment of outcomes while controlling for known COVID-19 risk factors . There is also limited data in patients with advanced HIV disease (i.e. low CD4 cell count).  
One systematic review, notably published as a pre-print, found of 144,795 hospitalized COVID-19 patients in North America, Europe, and Asia the pooled prevalence of HIV in COVID-19 patients was 1.22% [95% (CI): 0.61%-2.43%)] translating to a 2-fold increase compared to the respective local-level pooled HIV prevalence in the general population of 0.65% (95% CI: 0.48%-0.89%) – which hinted at a potential susceptibility among PLHIV .  
Additional data on this topic come from several cohort studies from South Africa, the USA and the UK have reported a moderate increased risk of death directly attributed to HIV infection after adjustments for age, sex, ethnicity and presence of comorbidities; an unpublished meta-analysis including these studies found that the risk of death was almost double that of HIV-negative patients; however, confounding by comorbidities associated with increased risk of severe COVID-19 cannot be ruled out. 
Protecting people living with HIV during the COVID-19 pandemic, and ensuring they can maintain treatment, is critical. Researchers are currently investigating whether people with HIV have an increased risk of poor outcomes with COVID-19. Preliminary evidence of moderate increased vulnerability of people with HIV makes it even more urgent that people with HIV have access to ARVs and treatments for comorbidities – such as treatment for hypertension, cardiovascular disease, chronic pulmonary disease, diabetes, tuberculosis, and maintenance of a healthy body weight.  
A larger dataset from a broader geographical representation is required to expand understanding of how SARS-CoV-2 co-infection with HIV impacts the severity of illness, disease progression and outcomes from hospitalization with COVID-19. For this purpose, WHO has established a Global COVID-19 Clinical Platform. As of 4 November 2020, WHO has received clinical data from 79,000 patients hospitalized with confirmed or suspected COVID-19, including from 5291 hospitalized patients living with HIV, from over 30 countries around the world. The platform is open to all Member States and health facilities to contribute data and inclusion will help inform future guidance on how best to ensure PLHIV are well protected during the COVID-19 pandemic.
PLHIV are advised to take the same COVID-19 precautions as recommended for the general population : wash hands often; practice cough etiquette; ensure physical distancing; wear masks when appropriate and according to local regulations; seek medical care if symptomatic; self-isolate if one develops symptoms or has contact with a positive  COVID-19 case; and other actions per the local and government response.  
It is important to ensure that PLHIV have access to antiretroviral drugs for longer periods (3-6 month supply); and that programmes practise multi-month dispensing (MMD) of ARVs, as well as, other necessary medications, such as, opiate substitution therapy (OST), TB preventive therapy (TPT) and treatments for comorbidities. It is also important to ensure that some vaccinations are up to date (influenza and pneumococcal vaccines) and there is access to adequate supplies of medicines to treat or prevent co-infections and comorbidities.

209,209,"Can antiretrovirals or direct-acting antivirals against hepatitis C virus be used to treat COVID-19?
"," Antiretroviral drugs were initially considered for use in the treatment of COVID-19 based on virtual screening and in vitro studies. Published data indicate that most patients infected with the virus causing COVID-19 have mild to moderate symptoms, have good clinical outcomes and do not require hospitalization. In some cases, patients admitted to the hospital were given an antiretroviral drug, most often lopinavir boosted with ritonavir (LPV/r) or, less frequently, darunavir boosted with ritonavir (DRV/r). Studies assessing the potential benefit of an antiretroviral drug on COVID-19 were mostly carried out in HIV-negative individuals.
A systematic review on use of antiretrovirals in patients with coronaviruses, conducted in March 2020 identified two randomized trials and 21 observational studies provided clinical outcome data on the use of LPV/r for the treatment of COVID‐19, SARS and MERS. The randomized trials showed no clinical benefit, the observational studies were inconclusive, and the certainty of the body of evidence across all important outcomes was low or very low quality. A living systematic review and network meta-analysis on the efficacy and safety of drug treatments for COVID-19 published in September 2020 did not find any convincing evidence that antiretrovirals drugs such as lopinavir/ritonavir reduced the mortality or increased the rate of viral clearance.
More recently, two additional randomized studies confirmed these findings and didn't support the use of LPV/r for treatment of hospitalized patients with COVID-19.
A recently published clinical trial showed that in patients admitted to hospital with COVID-19, LPV/r was not associated with reductions in mortality, duration of hospital stay, or risk of progressing to invasive mechanical ventilation or death.  Similarly, in the WHO-coordinated Solidarity Trial recently published, LPV/r appears to have little or no effect on hospitalized COVID-19 patients, as indicated by overall mortality, initiation of ventilation and duration of hospital stay.
Based on available evidence, the use of LPV/r and other antiretrovirals are not likely to improve clinical outcomes in hospitalized individuals with COVID-19.
Several randomized and nonrandomized studies have evaluated anti-hepatitis C drugs including sofosbuvir and daclatasvir for treating of SARS-CoV-2 and while these preliminary results suggested benefit in terms of clinical recovery, this evidence is insufficient (small sample size, inclusion of a nonrandomized study) to be able to recommend using these antivirals for treating SARS-CoV-2.

210,210,"What is WHO’s position on the use of antiretrovirals for the treatment or prevention of COVID-19?
","WHO does not currently recommend the use of antiretrovirals as treatment or prevention of COVID-19, outside of the context of clinical trials. Existing published literature on antiretrovirals is mostly observational in nature, with few clinical trials; and does not provide good quality evidence in favor of these agents for these purposes. The current body of evidence does not show the benefit of using LPV/r and other antiretrovirals to reduce the risk of new coronavirus infection or improve clinical outcomes in symptomatic disease among patients with COVID‐19.
More recently, two additional randomized studies confirmed these findings and didn't support the use of LPV/r for treatment of hospitalized patients with COVID-19. The Recovery trial showed that LPV/r was not associated with reduction in mortality, time of hospitalization stay and risk of progressing to invasive mechanical ventilation or death.The interim results of the WHO multi country adaptive trial (Solidarity trial) also found that LPV/r had little or no effect on overall mortality, initiation of ventilation and duration of hospital stay in hospitalized patients with COVID-19.

211,211,"How can programmes assure continued access to HIV services?
","Continuous access to essential HIV prevention, testing and treatment services must be assured, including in settings where measurements of confinement are implemented within the public health response to the COVID-19 pandemic. Adapted and evidence-based measures to reduce possible transmission should be considered and implemented. These include:
Applying standard precautions for all patients (including ensuring that all patients cover their nose and mouth with a tissue or elbow when coughing or sneezing, offering a medical mask to patients with suspected COVID-19 infection while they are in waiting in the service, performing hand hygiene etc.)
Health care and outreach workers, as well as peer educators and clients should apply hand hygiene and other protective measures
Ensuring triage, early recognition, and source control (isolating patients with suspected COVID-19 infection)
Ensure there is adequate ventilation in all areas in the healthcare facility
Spatial distance between 1 and 2 meters should ideally be maintained between all patients within all types of services
Cleaning and disinfection procedures should be followed consistently and correctly
Dispensing medicines (for treatment of HIV, TB and other chronic conditions such as opioid dependence) for longer periods allowing reduced frequency of patient visits
Consider reduction of services to the most critical ones (provision of essential treatment and prevention services; services such as counseling sessions may be reduced or adapted)
Many countries have developed virtual ways of delivering services and supporting people to reduce clinic attendance.
Countries have also increased self-care options, for example HIV self-testing, often in combination with virtual support to keep services going.  
There are many examples of innovations being used to support the continuation of PrEP services including virtual support, community and home distribution and using HIVST for monitoring during periods when clinic services have been suspended.  Learning from these may help guide future implementation in the post-COVID-9 era.   
Generally, vulnerable populations, including members of key populations (men who have sex with men, sex workers, people who use drugs, transgender people and people in prisons) as well as homeless and/or displaced people may be at increased risk of infection – because of additional comorbidities impacting on their immune system, reduced ability to apply measures of confinement and social distancing, as well as generally limited access to health services. It is critical that services that reach these populations such as community-based services, drop-in centers and outreach services can continue providing life-saving HIV prevention (distribution of condoms, PrEP, needles and syringes), testing and treatment while securing safety of staff and clients. Services can be adapted according to above considerations where applicable.  Some prevention services, such as voluntary medical male circumcision (VMMC), which require clinic attendance, were initially suspended in the early phases of the response to the COVID-19 epidemic. Some countries, following assessing the covid situation, have adjusted their responses and are restating VMMC services with additional COVID-19 prevention measures.

212,212,"Should pregnant and breastfeeding women living with HIV with COVID-19 and their newborns be managed differently?
","here is currently no well-established difference between the clinical manifestations of COVID-19 or risk of severe illness or fetal compromise for pregnant and non-pregnant women with HIV. However, a recent large database study conducted by US-CDC suggested that pregnant women with COVID-19 are more likely to need intensive care due an increased relative risk of developing severe disease. Pregnant women with suspected or confirmed COVID-19 should be treated with supportive and management therapies, considering the immunologic and physiologic adaptations during and after pregnancy which may overlap with COVID-19 symptoms. Data is limited but, until the evidence base provides clearer information, special consideration should be given to pregnant women with concomitant medical illnesses who could be infected with COVID-19. There are no reported deaths in pregnant women at time of publishing this information . However, COVID-19 testing of symptomatic pregnant women may need to be prioritized to enable access to specialized care.  All recently pregnant women with COVID-19 or who have recovered from COVID-19 should be provided with information and counseling on safe infant feeding and appropriate IPC measures to prevent COVID-19 virus transmission.
With confirmed disease or under investigation, management is similar to non-pregnant women, with appropriate isolation of confirmed or under investigation.  Obstetric facilities must be notified and prepared, noting that each infant born to any mother with confirmed COVID-19 should be considered a ‘person under investigation’ and should be isolated according to the IPC guidance.  Currently, it is unknown whether newborns with COVID-19 are at increased risk for severe complications.

213,213,"Someone in my household tested positive for COVID-19. Is it safe to care for them at home?
","People at high risk for severe illness and death from COVID-19 may require care that cannot be provided at home. Contact your healthcare provider for advice. People at high risk include: 
people aged 60 and older; 
people who are pregnant and age 35 and older, and who are obese or have chronic medical conditions;
people of any age with chronic medical conditions (such as chronic cardiac, pulmonary, renal, metabolic, neurologic, liver or hematologic diseases); and 
people with immunosuppressive conditions (such as HIV/AIDS, patients receiving chemotherapy or steroids, and people with cancer.) 
If you are in any high-risk groups and you are NOT vaccinated, you are at risk of more severe disease and death.
If you have recently tested positive for COVID-19 infection, have mild symptoms AND are at high risk of severe disease, contact your health provider. There may be effective treatments available to you.
If someone in your home is not at high risk for severe disease, tests positive for COVID-19, and has no symptoms or mild symptoms, they can usually be cared for safely at home.As you take care of others, don’t forget to take care of yourself too. Wear a medical mask when sharing a space with someone with COVID-19. Everyone should follow prevention measures:
Stay at least 1 meter away from the sick person;
Where possible, open windows to bring fresh air into the sick person’s room;
Cough or sneeze into a bent elbow;
Clean your hands frequently; and
Get vaccinated as soon as it is your turn.

214,214,"Someone in my household tested positive for COVID-19. They have very mild symptoms, and our doctor says it is safe for me to care for them at home. What should I do to keep myself and others in the household healthy?
","It’s hard when someone close to you is unwell. Even though you may want to provide comfort and company to your ill relative, it is important to reduce the likelihood that you or other family members catch COVID-19. For people with mild or moderate symptoms, the best thing you can do is provide the care they need while also keeping a safe distance.
First of all – protect the health of others in the household
People with COVID-19 infection should (where possible) be isolated in a separate room, away from others in the home. If possible, close the door to stop air from moving from the infected person’s room into the rest of the home. If it’s safe, open windows and turn on a fan in the room if you have one. No other visitors should be allowed in the home when someone in the household has COVID-19 infection. Follow guidance from your country’s health department or ministry regarding whether or not close contacts need to be isolated at home.
If it is not possible to isolate the infected person in your home, try to move people at risk of severe disease to a household where they will not be exposed to possible infection.
If you have to share space in your home with someone with COVID-19, open windows to bring in fresh air if it’s safe to do so. COVID-19 spreads easily in places that are poorly ventilated. Learn more about ventilation.
Secondly - protect the health of the person caring for the person with COVID-19 infection
The spread of the COVID-19 virus occurs most often when an infected person is in close or direct contact with another person. If possible, there should be only one person in the household providing care to the person who has COVID-19 infection.
If possible, choose someone to be the caregiver who is healthy and not at high risk. Caregivers should wash their hands before AND after any interaction with the person with COVID-19 infection. Both the caregiver and the person who is infected should wear a medical mask whenever they share a space with each other. If possible, open windows when the caregiver is in the room with the person with COVID-19 infection.
Monitor how you feel.
Caregivers and others in a home with a person with COVID-19 infection should pay close attention to how they feel (even if they are vaccinated or are being careful). On average, it takes 5-6 days from when someone is infected for symptoms to show. However, it can take up to 14 days.
Symptoms may vary. Monitor yourself and others in your home for any symptoms of COVID-19 -- including fever, cough, tiredness, loss of taste or smell, sore throat, muscle or body ache, headache, running nose, loss of appetite, nausea, diarrhea or shortness of breath. Or altered mental status.  Get tested if you have any of these symptoms. 
Seek immediate medical care if you have any of these severe symptoms of COVID-19: 
Difficulty breathing
Chest pain
Confusion
Loss of speech or mobility 
For young children, seek immediate medical care if you notice any of these symptoms:
High fever
Rapid breathing
Lethargy or not interacting when awake
Difficulty in feeding (unable to drink or breastfeed)
Blue lips or face
If you think you may have COVID-19 infection and are waiting for test results, avoid contact with other people if possible until you know whether or not you are infected. 
Watch for warning signs.
Pay attention to any changes in the signs and symptoms of a person with COVID-19 infection in your care. Some symptoms may be signals that more urgent medical care is needed. Depending on the age of the person in your care, their symptoms may look different. Adults may look dehydrated, have shortness of breath or chest pains. They may also complain of light-headedness. Children may suddenly appear confused or refuse to eat. Their face or lips may turn blue. Babies may be unable to breastfeed. These symptoms are warning signs that urgent care is needed.
If the person with COVID-19 infection under your care shows any of these signs, contact your healthcare provider immediately. 
Keep things clean.
Any surfaces and household items touched by the person with COVID-19 infection should be cleaned and disinfected at least once a day. Household items include dishes, cups and flatware. 
COVID-19 can spread from an infected person’s mouth or nose in small liquid particles when they cough, sneeze, speak, sing or breathe. These particles range from larger respiratory droplets to smaller aerosols.
Current evidence suggests that the virus spreads mainly between people who are in close contact with each other, typically within 1 meter. A person can be infected when aerosols or droplets containing the virus are inhaled or come directly into contact with the eyes, nose, or mouth. The virus can also spread in poorly ventilated and/or crowded indoor settings, where people tend to spend longer periods of time. This is because aerosols remain suspended in the air or travel farther than 1 meter.
People may also become infected by touching surfaces that have been contaminated with the virus and then touching their eyes, nose or mouth without cleaning their hands.
Continue to practice prevention measures.
Keep a distance of at least 1 meter from others;
Wear a well-fitted mask over your mouth and nose;
Open windows
Cough or sneeze into a bent elbow;
Clean your hands frequently; and
Get vaccinated as soon as it’s your turn.

215,215,"My child has tested positive for COVID-19. What should I do?
","If your child tests positive for COVID-19, contact your healthcare provider for guidance. You should seek immediate care if a baby is unable to breastfeed, or if a child is unable to drink, has high fever, rapid breathing, suddenly appears lethargic or doesn’t interact when they are awake, or if their face or lips turn blue.
It’s natural to feel concerned or anxious about your child’s health if they are infected with COVID-19.  While some of the same home care guidance applies to children and adults, there are special considerations when taking care of a child.
Take care of the child with COVID-19 infection
It is natural for children to be anxious and concerned after testing positive for COVID-19. Listen to their concerns, and help them understand why it’s important to rest and keep a distance from other family members. Encourage them to rest, to stay hydrated and to eat healthy foods. If they are old enough, talk to them about COVID-19 and share accurate information. Reassure your child that their health and safety is your top priority.
Be responsive to your child’s needs. Think up ways together for children to stay connected with other family members and friends. Make the space in which the child and caregiver are isolating as child-friendly as possible. Play and learning continue to be an important part of a child’s life. 
Reduce contact with others
The spread of the COVID-19 virus occurs most often when a person with COVID-19 infection is in close or direct contact with another person.
WHO recommends that people with COVID-19 be isolated in a separate room away from other members of the household. However, children should not be isolated on their own. If possible, there should be only one person, who is healthy and not at high risk, in the household providing care to the child with infection. The designated caregiver should take care of the child at all times and monitor their symptoms and safety.
The caregiver should wear a medical mask when caring for the infected child and should wash their hands before AND after any interaction with the infected child. If it is possible and safe, keep the room or space well ventilated and open windows frequently. The child with COVID-19 infection should wear a medical mask in shared spaces, as long as the child can tolerate it.
Prevent transmission to others
If it is safe and possible, open windows to get fresh air into the room where the child with COVID-19 infection is staying. Where it is not possible to separate the child and caregiver from the rest of the family, try to separate those at high risk for severe disease from the child with infection and their caregiver.  
Keep things clean: Any surfaces and household items, such as dishes, cups and cutlery, touched by the child with COVID-19 infection should be cleaned and disinfected at least once a day. Separate dishes and eating utensils should be used from the infected child.
Encourage members of the household to clean their hands frequently using soap and water or an alcohol-based hand sanitiser.
Monitor the child with COVID-19 infection and others
The caregiver and others in a home with a child with COVID-19 infection should pay close attention to how they feel (even if they are vaccinated or are being careful). On average, it takes 5-6 days from when someone is infected for symptoms to show. However, it can take up to 14 days.

","A pulse oximeter is a small medical device used to measure the level of oxygen in the blood. People with COVID-19 may have low oxygen levels, which can be life-threatening.
To measure the level of oxygen in the blood, a pulse oximeter is usually placed on the finger or toe of the person who is sick. Using a pulse oximeter is painless and only takes a few minutes. If your healthcare provider recommends the use of a pulse oximeter, be sure to get instructions about how to use it and how to read and understand the results, and report them to your healthcare provider. Accurate measurements and readings from a pulse oximeter are important signs in determining if and when a COVID-19 patient at home may need urgent care at a healthcare facility.

Patients should be assessed on a case-by-case basis by the health worker to determine where their care needs can best be met.","['demand', 'ass', 'determin', 'aadhaar', 'home', 'capac', 'case', 'inpati', 'care', 'healthcar', 'insuffici', 'servic', 'may', 'hospit', 'circumst', 'patient', 'unavail', 'unsaf', 'howev', 'meet', 'health', 'ideal', 'covid', 'worker', 'need', 'requir', 'met', 'facil', 'basi', 'best']"
222,222,"What factors determine whether a COVID-19 patient can be cared for at home?
","Patients with mild or moderate disease can be considered for home care if the home setting is suitable for the isolation and care of a COVID-19 patient, and if the patient is under the age of 60, does not smoke, is not obese, and does not have other diseases such as cardiovascular disease, diabetes mellitus, chronic lung disease, cancer, chronic kidney disease, immunosuppression. An assessment about home care for each patient should be based on the following factors:
Clinical evaluation of the patient.
Evaluation of the patient’s home setting according to infection prevention and control (IPC) criteria (e.g., ability to carry out hand and respiratory hygiene, environmental cleaning, adequate ventilation, limitations on movement around or from the house).
Presence of vulnerable people at higher risk of COVID-19 in the home.
Ability of a caregiver to provide care and closely monitor the evolution of the patient’s health, at least once per day, and to recognize signs and symptoms of any worsening of the health status.
Availability of trained health workers to support the patient and caregiver (home-based, phone, telemedicine, trained community workers or outreach teams).
If adequate isolation from others in the home and infection prevention control measures cannot be ensured, then isolation in designated community facilities or a health facility may need to be arranged, with consent from the patient and in agreement with the caregiver and household members.
It is important to note that in areas with other endemic infections that cause fever, such as influenza, malaria, dengue, etc., febrile patients should seek medical care, be tested and treated for those endemic infections per routine protocols, irrespective of the presence of respiratory signs and symptoms.
Home care does not replace healthcare by professionals. Those patients who receive homecare should be regularly monitored by health workers.

These include difficulty breathing/fast or shallow breathing (for infants: grunting, inability to breastfeed), blue lips or face, chest pain or pressure, new confusion, inability to awaken/not interacting when awake, inability to drink or keep down any liquids.
If caregivers are suspected or have confirmed COVID-19 infection, medical and non-medical factors must be taken into account due to the negative and possible long-term consequences of even a short period of family separation.

227,227,"How does COVID-19 spread between people?
","We know that the disease is caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus, which spreads between people in several different ways.
Current evidence suggests that the virus spreads mainly between people who are in close contact with each other, for example at a conversational distance. The virus can spread from an infected person’s mouth or nose in small liquid particles when they cough, sneeze, speak, sing or breathe. Another person can then contract the virus when infectious particles that pass through the air are inhaled at short range (this is often called short-range aerosol or short-range airborne transmission) or if infectious particles come into direct contact with the eyes, nose, or mouth (droplet transmission).
The virus can also spread in poorly ventilated and/or crowded indoor settings, where people tend to spend longer periods of time. This is because aerosols can remain suspended in the air or travel farther than conversational distance (this is often called long-range aerosol or long-range airborne transmission).
People may also become infected when touching their eyes, nose or mouth after touching surfaces or objects that have been contaminated by the virus. 
Further research is ongoing to better understand the spread of the virus and which settings are most risky and why. Research is also under way to study virus variants that are emerging and why some are more transmissible.

228,228,"When do infected people transmit the virus?
","Whether or not they have symptoms, infected people can be contagious and the virus can spread from them to other people.
Laboratory data suggests that infected people appear to be most infectious just before they develop symptoms (namely 2 days before they develop symptoms) and early in their illness. People who develop severe disease can be infectious for longer.
While someone who never develops symptoms can pass the virus to others, it is still not clear how frequently this occurs and more research is needed in this area.

229,229,"What is the difference between people who are asymptomatic or pre-symptomatic? Don’t they both mean someone without symptoms?
","Yes, any situation in which people are in close proximity to one another for long periods of time increases the risk of transmission. Indoor locations, especially settings where there is poor ventilation, are riskier than outdoor locations. Activities where more particles are expelled from the mouth, such as singing or breathing heavily during exercise, also increase the risk of transmission.
The “Three C’s” are a useful way to think about this. They describe settings where transmission of the COVID-19 virus spreads more easily:
Crowded places;
Close-contact settings, especially where people have conversations very near each other;
Confined and enclosed spaces with poor ventilation.  
In health facilities where people are receiving treatment for COVID-19, there is an increased risk of infection during medical procedures called aerosol generating procedures. These can produce very small droplets that can stay suspended in the air for longer periods of time and spread beyond conversational distances (typically 1 meter). This is why health workers performing these procedures or in settings where these procedures are performed should take specific airborne protection measures, including using appropriate personal protective equipment such as respirators. This is also why visitors are not permitted in areas where these procedures are being performed.

Follow local guidance: Check to see what national, regional and local authorities are advising so you have the most relevant information for where you are.
Keep your distance: Stay at least 1 meter away from others, even if they don’t appear to be sick, since people can have the virus without having symptoms.
Wear a mask:  Wear a well-fitting three-layer mask, especially when you can’t physically distance yourself, or if you’re indoors. Clean your hands before putting on and taking off a mask.
Avoid crowded places, poorly ventilated, indoor locations and avoid prolonged contact with others. Spend more time outdoors than indoors.
Ventilation is important: Open windows when indoors to increase the amount of outdoor air.
Avoid touching surfaces, especially in public settings or health facilities, in case people infected with COVID-19 have touched them. Clean surfaces regularly with standard disinfectants.
Frequently clean your hands with soap and water, or an alcohol-based hand rub. If you can, carry alcohol-based rub with you and use it often.
Cover your coughs and sneezes with a bent elbow or tissue, throwing used tissues into a closed bin right away. Then wash your hands or use an alcohol-based hand rub.

","As of March 2020, there have been reports of the suspension of insecticide-treated net (ITN) and indoor residual spraying (IRS) campaigns in several African countries due to concerns around exposure to COVID-19. Suspending such campaigns will leave many vulnerable populations at greater risk of malaria, particularly young children and pregnant women. 
WHO strongly encourages countries not to suspend the planning for – or implementation of – vector control activities, including ITN and IRS campaigns, while ensuring these services are delivered using best practices to protect health workers and communities from COVID-19 infection. Modifications of planned distribution strategies may be needed to minimize exposure to the coronavirus. 
WHO commends the leaders of Benin, Chad, the Central African Republic, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Mali, Niger, Sierra Leone and Uganda for committing to move forward with ITN campaigns during the pandemic. Other countries are adapting their net distribution strategies to ensure households receive the nets as quickly and safely as possible.
Together with partners, WHO has developed guidance to ensure that those suffering from malaria can safely receive the care they need in COVID-19 settings.Tailoring malaria interventions in the COVID-19 response includes guidance on the prevention of infection through vector control and chemoprevention, testing, treatment of cases, clinical services, supply chain and laboratory activities.

As signs and symptoms of malaria and COVID-19 can overlap (such as a fever), public health messages will need to be adapted in malaria-endemic settings so that people who have a fever are encouraged to seek immediate treatment rather than stay at home; without prompt treatment, a mild case of malaria can rapidly progress to severe illness and death.

238,238,"What additional special measures may be needed in the context of COVID-19?
","In addition to routine approaches to malaria control, there may be a case for special measures in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic – such as a temporary return to presumptive malaria treatment, or the use of mass drug administration – which have proved useful in some previous emergencies. 
Presumptive malaria treatment refers to treatment of a suspected malaria case without the benefit of diagnostic confirmation (e.g. through a rapid diagnostic test). This approach is typically reserved for extreme circumstances, such as disease in settings where prompt diagnosis is no longer possible.
Mass drug administration (MDA) is a WHO-recommended approach for rapidly reducing malaria mortality and morbidity during epidemics and in complex emergency settings. Through MDA, all individuals in a targeted population are given antimalarial medicines – often at repeated intervals – regardless of whether or not they show symptoms of the disease. 
Such special measures should only be adopted after careful consideration of 2 key aims: lowering malaria-related mortality and keeping health workers and communities safe. WHO is exploring concrete proposals for when and how to activate such measures; guidance will be published in due course.

A modeling analysis from WHO and partners, published on 23 April, found that the number of malaria deaths in sub-Saharan Africa could double this year alone if there are severe disruptions in access to insecticide-treated nets and antimalarial medicines due to COVID-19. These projections reinforce the critical importance of sustaining efforts to prevent, detect and treat malaria during the pandemic.
In all regions, protective measures should be utilized to minimize the risk of COVID-19 transmission between patients, communities and health providers. WHO and partners have developed guidance on how to safely maintain malaria prevention and treatment services in COVID-19 settings.

242,242,"What is WHO’s position on the use of chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine in the context of the COVID-19 response?
","WHO is actively following the ongoing clinical trials that are being conducted in response to COVID-19, including the more than 80 studies looking at the use of chloroquine and its derivative, hydroxychloroquine, for treatment and/or prevention. 
To date, 3 large randomized controlled trials, including the WHO Solidarity trial, have failed to show that the use of hydroxychloroquine among hospitalized patients infected with COVID-19 can prevent death or disease progression. Additionally, 3 trials of patients with mild or moderate disease failed to show a significant benefit in prevention of respiratory failure through the use of hydroxychloroquine. Thus, there is now growing evidence that hydroxychloroquine is not an effective treatment for COVID-19. This evidence will inform the next update of WHO guidance on therapeutics. 
Studies on the use of chloroquine or hydroxychloroquine to prevent individuals, particularly those at high risk such as health care workers, from contracting COVID-19 are ongoing. Currently, there is insufficient evidence to assess the protective efficacy of either of these medicines for the prevention of COVID-19 infection or disease. 
WHO cautions physicians against administering these unproven treatments to patients with COVID-19 outside the context of a clinical trial. Individuals are also advised against self-medicating with these drugs.
For public health emergencies, WHO has a systematic and transparent process for research and development (R & D), including for clinical trials of drugs. The WHO R&D Blueprint for COVID-19, initiated on 7 January 2020, aims to fast-track the availability of effective tests, vaccines and medicines that can be used to save lives and avert large-scale crises.

","The most widely used antimalarial treatments, artemisinin-based combination therapies (ACTs), are produced using the pure artemisinin compound extracted from the plant Artemisia annua. There have been reports that products or extracts (e.g. herbal teas or tablets) made from Artemisia plant material may have a preventive or curative effect on COVID-19. 
However, available in vitro data suggests that purified artemisinin compounds or A. annua plant product or extracts do not have an appreciable effect against COVID-19 at concentrations that could be safely achieved in humans. As such, current evidence does not support the use of artemisinins or A. annua products or extracts as an antiviral for COVID-19. 
WHO urges extreme caution over reports touting the efficacy of such products. As explained in a WHO position statement, there is no scientific evidence base to support the use of non-pharmaceutical forms of Artemisia for the prevention or treatment of malaria. There is also no evidence to suggest that COVID-19 can be prevented or treated with products made from Artemisia-based plant material.

Disposable medical masks which comply with medical mask standards EN 14683 Type I, ASTM F2100 Level 1, YY/T 0969, YY 0469 (or equivalent); 
Other types of well-fitting non-medical masks, including homemade multi-layered masks are an acceptable option, when other options are not available. 
Disposable medical masks are also recommended for the following groups, because if infected, they are at a higher risk of becoming seriously ill with COVID-19 and dying:
People aged 60 or over.
People of any age with underlying health conditions, including chronic respiratory disease, cardiovascular disease, cancer, obesity, immunocompromised patients and diabetes mellitus. 
Disposable medical masks are also recommended for:
Anyone who is feeling unwell, including people with mild symptoms, such as muscle aches, slight cough, sore throat or fatigue.
Anyone awaiting COVID-19 test results or who has recently tested positive.
A respirator or a medical mask should be worn by caregivers at any setting where care is provided to patients with suspected or confirmed COVID-19, including home care, long-term care facilities and community care settings.

247,247,"When should masks be worn by the public?
","In settings where there is community or cluster transmission of SARS-CoV-2, irrespective of vaccination status or history of prior infection, wearing a well-fitting mask that covers the nose and mouth is recommended for the public when interacting with individuals who are not members of their household:
in indoor settings where ventilation is known to be poor or cannot be assessed, or the ventilation system is not properly maintained, regardless of whether physical distancing of at least 1 meter can be maintained;
in indoor settings that have adequate ventilation if physical distancing of at least 1 meter cannot be maintained; or
in outdoor settings where physical distancing of at least 1 meter cannot be maintained.
It’s not always easy to determine the quality of ventilation. If you have any doubts, it’s safer to simply wear a mask. While wearing a mask, you should continue to maintain physical distance from others as much as possible. Wearing a mask does not mean you can have close contact with people.

","A respirator or a medical mask should be worn by health workers along with other personal protective equipment (PPE) - gown, gloves and eye protection - before entering a room where there is a patient with suspected or confirmed COVID-19.
Respirators or medical masks should be worn throughout their shifts, apart from when eating, drinking or needing to change the respirator or medical mask for specific reasons.
Health workers must remember to combine hand hygiene with any time they touch their respirator or medical mask or face, before and after putting on and removing them, as well as before they touch them to readjust them.
Health workers should continue to physically distance and avoid unnecessary close contact with colleagues and others in the healthcare facility when not providing patient care.
Respirators should be worn in the following situations:
In healthcare facilities where ventilation is known to be poor or cannot be assessed, or the ventilation system is not properly maintained.

249,249,"What is the difference between medical masks and respirators, like N95s?
","Medical masks (also known as surgical masks) are:
composed of 3 layers of synthetic nonwoven materials
configured to have filtration layers sandwiched in the middle
available in different thicknesses
have various levels of fluid-resistance and filtration
Respirators (also known as filtering facepiece respirators – FFP) are available at different performance levels such as FFP2, FFP3, N95, N99, N100.
Medical masks and respirator masks are similar in their filtration value. However, respirators also have a tight fit around the wearer face as the model and size of the respirator is specific to the wearer to ensure an adequate seal. Respirator masks are designed to protect health workers who provide care to COVID-19 patients in settings and areas where aerosol generating procedures are undertaken. They are also recommended for health workers providing care to suspected or confirmed COVID-19 patients in settings where ventilation is known to be poor or cannot be assessed or the ventilation system is not properly maintained.
Health workers should be fit tested before using a respirator to ensure that they are wearing the correct size. Wearing a loose-fitting respirator will not offer the same level of protection to the wearer as it may allow small particles to get inside the mask where there are gaps, for example through the side.

If you purchase a non-medical mask, check the labels to make sure it complies with the ASTM F3502 standard or CEN Working Agreement 17553.
If you choose to make your own mask, it should be made of three layers of fabric:
Inner layer of absorbent material, such as cotton.
Middle layer of non-woven non-absorbent material, such as polypropylene.
Outer layer of non-absorbent material, such as polyester or polyester blend.
For either type of mask, you should choose the one that fits your face well - cover your nose, cheeks and chin without leaving gaps on the sides. Masks with vents or exhalation valves are not advised because they allow unfiltered breath to escape the mask.

251,251,"In healthcare facilities, when should medical masks be worn?
","When health workers are caring for COVID-19 patients, they should wear a respirator or a medical mask.
If COVID-19 is widely spreading, visitors, along with health workers and caregivers, should wear a well-fitting medical mask at all times when caring for non-COVID-19 patients and in all common areas, even if physical distancing can be maintained. 
Health workers, caregivers and visitors must remember to combine hand hygiene with any time they touch their medical mask or face, before and after putting on and removing them, as well as before they touch them to readjust them.
Health workers should continue to physically distance and avoid unnecessary close contact with colleagues and others in the facility when not providing patient care.
Inpatients are not required to wear a medical mask in general. A mask may be required if physical distancing of at least 1 meter cannot be maintained (e.g., during examinations or bedside visits) or when the patient is outside of their care area (e.g., when being transported), provided the patient is able to tolerate the mask and there are no contraindications.

Adjust the mask to cover your mouth, nose, and chin, leaving no gaps on the sides.
Place the straps behind your head or ears. Do not cross the straps because this can cause gaps on the side of your face.
Avoid touching the mask while wearing it. If you touch it, clean your hands.
Change your mask if it gets dirty or wet.
How to take off and store a fabric mask:
Clean your hands before taking off the mask.
Take off the mask by removing it from the ear loops, without touching the front of the mask.
If your fabric mask is not dirty or wet and you plan to reuse it, put it in a clean resealable bag. If you need to use it again, hold the mask at the elastic loops when removing it from the bag. Clean your mask once a day.
Clean your hands after removing the mask.
How to clean a fabric mask:
Wash fabric masks in soap or detergent and preferably hot water (at least 60 degrees Centigrade/140 degrees Fahrenheit) at least once a day.

","High profile international sporting events such as the Olympics or World Cups as well as international religious events such as the Hajj count as mass gatherings. However, lower profile conferences and events can also meet WHO’s definition of a mass gathering. An event counts as a “mass gathering” if the number of people it brings together is so large that it has the potential to strain the planning and response resources of the health system in the community where it takes place. You need to consider the location and duration of the event as well as the number of participants. For example, if the event takes place over several days in a small island state where the capacity of the health system is quite limited then even an event with just a few thousand participants could place a big strain on the health system and then be considered a “mass gathering” event. Conversely, if the event is held in a big city in a country with a large, well-resourced health system and lasts just a few hours, the event may not constitute a “mass gathering” event.","['profil', 'larg', 'cup', 'particip', 'strain', 'count', 'place', 'take', 'resourc', 'consid', 'number', 'gather', 'island', 'thousand', 'confer', 'constitut', 'hajj', 'meet', 'health', 'convers', 'held', 'big', 'intern', 'mass', 'religi', 'event', 'olymp', 'citi', 'system', 'well']"
256,256,"Does WHO recommend that all international mass gatherings be canceled because of COVID-19?
","No. As each international mass gathering is different, the factors to consider when determining if the event should be canceled may also differ. Any decision to change a planned international gathering should be based on a careful assessment of the risks and how they can be managed, and the level of event planning. The assessment should involve all stakeholders in the event, and in particular the health authorities in the country or community where the event is due to take place. These authorities and stakeholders are in the best position to assess the level of stress the event might place on the local health system and emergency services – and whether this level of stress is acceptable in the current situation.
It is WHO’s view that all countries with community transmission should seriously consider postponing or reducing mass gatherings that bring people together and have the potential to amplify disease and support the recommended best practice of physical distancing. Any decision will be supported through the use of WHO tools, in particular the Risk Assessment for Mass Gatherings during COVID-19.
If movement restrictions and further national measures have been established in the country, the WHO RA does not apply. However, when the process of re-opening/conducting mass gatherings is being considered post movement restrictions, it will be key to ensure any decisions are based on a risk assessment, such as the WHO Mass gatherings COVID-19 risk assessment.

257,257,"What factors should organizers and health authorities look at when assessing whether the risks are acceptable or not?
","For countries not currently known to be experiencing community transmission of COVID-19, the priority consideration will be whether the planned mass gathering event substantially increases the risk of the virus entering the country and becoming established, as well as the risk for participants to import infection back to their home country and further increasing global spread. In making this assessment, the organizers and their national or local health authorities should recognize that the risk of imported cases of COVID-19 is naturally linked to international travel. They should also recognize that it is neither realistic or desirable to aim for zero risk. When organizers and health authorities are determining whether to hold a mass gathering, they should determine what is an acceptable risk and what additional measures should be implemented to mitigate the risks.
For countries where COVID-19 has already started to spread in the community, key consideration will be:
aiming at containing or at least slowing down the spread of the virus in the local community/country.
preventing participants from other countries being infected with COVID-19  
In each case the risk should be considered in the context of the known features of COVID-19, its severity, its transmissibility and the effectiveness of measures to prevent or reduce transmission. The strain already placed on the local health system in responding to COVID-19 outbreak(s), and the additional strain the mass gathering might place on the system also need to be taken into account.

258,258,"What if my organization does not have the expertise to assess the risks COVID-19 poses for our planned mass gathering?
","The national and local public health authorities in the country where you plan to hold the mass gathering will most likely know how to conduct a health risk assessment.

259,259,"If we go ahead with an international mass gathering, what can we do to reduce the risk of participants catching COVID-19?
","Promote hand washing, respiratory hygiene and social distancing at the event. Make sure you have emergency contact details for all participants, including where they are staying during the event. You should make it clear to them that this information will be shared with the local public health authorities to enable rapid contact tracing if a participant at the event becomes ill with COVID-19. The event organizers need to have an agreed preparedness plan in case one or more participants become ill with COVID-19 symptoms. This should include rapid isolation of the ill person and their safe transfer to a local health facility.

260,260,"What should be the criteria for excluding an athlete or other accredited participant from competing?
","Agreed health criteria are needed for the exclusion of athletes from competing and for allowing them to return to competition wherever appropriate. These should be consistent with public health guidelines for the general population, with risk profiles based on recent travel to high-risk community transmission zones, recent contact with individuals diagnosed with or suspected of having COVID-19, current symptomatology, etc. Athletes who are feeling unwell should not participate in events.
If testing of athletes has been agreed with the local public health service there is a need to consider test availability, time taken for receipt of test results and host-country health services capacity.
Criteria for exclusion of officials/judges from competition and for allowing them to return to competition where appropriate should follow guidance and criteria for the workplace.
Requirements for the attendance of all athletes and other accredited participants should be put in place:
health check: travel declaration and temperature screening
contact tracing protocols ready (with all details of those present)
allowing extra spacing (physical distancing)
following all hygiene precautions. 
Isolation procedures for athletes and other accredited participants (e.g. field-of-play staff, medical teams, officials who have close contact with the athletes) who feel unwell or become symptomatic should be clear and documented and rehearsed prior to holding the event, especially for higher risk sports, e.g. contact sports.

261,261,"Should event organizers arrange screening at venues beyond national government requirements for point of entry (PoE)?
","Temperature screening alone, at exit or entry, is not an effective way to stop international spread, since infected individuals may be in incubation period, may not express apparent symptoms early on in the course of the disease, or may dissimulate fever through the use of antipyretics; in addition, such measures require substantial investments for what may bear little benefits. It is more effective to provide prevention recommendation messages to travelers and to collect health declarations at arrival, with travelers’ contact details, to allow for a proper risk assessment and a possible contact tracing of incoming travelers.
Event organizers should also consider the capacity to undertake this and the management of suspected cases. However, sporting organizations may have criteria for participation that are stricter than government requirements for Ports of Entry into the country that are based on event risk assessment, including organizers' healthcare capacity.
Any additional screening questionnaires for participation in events need to be aligned with public health agencies in the jurisdiction. There is a need to consider how to manage different groups – athletes, officials and spectators, and the large numbers of individuals likely to arrive at a sporting event from many oversea countries – and to follow both host country and WHO travel advice and to assess whether there is difficulty in obtaining accurate information about the travel history of those individuals.

Vaccination during pregnancy is important whenever there is risk of the disease, but especially for frontline health workers, people living in areas where there is high community transmission, and those with health conditions like hypertension (high blood pressure) and diabetes that add to risk of severe disease.   
Some evidence also suggests that babies may receive protective benefits from the vaccine, in addition to the benefits for pregnant women.
Pregnant women in many countries around the world have now received COVID-19 vaccines, and no safety concerns have been identified related to their pregnancies or the health of their babies. None of the COVID-19 vaccines authorized to date use live viruses, which are more likely to pose risks during pregnancy.

WHO does not recommend self-medication with any medicines, including antibiotics, as a prevention or cure for COVID-19. However, there are several ongoing clinical trials of both western and traditional medicines. WHO is coordinating efforts to develop vaccines and medicines to prevent and treat COVID-19 and will continue to provide updated information as soon as research results become available.

287,287,"What can I do to prevent infection?
","o prevent infection, there are five things that you can do.
1. Wash your hands frequently and thoroughly with soap and water and dry them thoroughly.
You can also use alcohol-based hand rub if your hands are not visibly dirty and if this product is available. Cleaning your hands frequently will remove the virus if it is on your hands. If an alcohol-based hand rub or soap is not available, then using chlorinated water (0.05%) for handwashing is an option, but it is not ideal because frequent use may irritate your skin.
 2. Cover your mouth and nose with a flexed elbow or tissue when coughing and sneezing.
And remember to throw away the used tissue immediately in a bin with a lid and to wash your hands. This way you protect others from any virus released through coughs and sneezes.
3. Avoid touching your eyes, nose and mouth.
Hands touch many surfaces which can be contaminated with the virus. If you touch your eyes, nose or mouth with unclean hands, you can transfer the virus from the surface to yourself.
4. Keep physical distance from others.
If your national or local authorities have put in place confinement measures, it is important to respect them. Taking exercise outside is good for your physical and mental health, but should only be undertaken if regulations for your area allow it. When you do go out, avoid crowded spaces and maintain at least 1 meter distance (3 feet or arms-length) from others. Avoid unnecessary visits to your house. If visits are necessary (e.g. caregiver to support activities of daily living), ask your visitor to regularly check for symptoms to ensure that they are symptom free when visiting you. Ask them to also follow these five key actions, including washing their hands when they first enter your home. 
5. Clean and disinfect frequently touched surfaces every day.
This includes tables, doorknobs, light switches, countertops, handles, desks, phones, keyboards, toilets, taps, and sinks. If surfaces are dirty, use detergent or soap and water prior to disinfection.

288,288,"What can older people do to prepare for COVID-19 in their community?
","There is a lot that you can do to prepare for COVID-19 in your community.
Inform yourself of the special measures taken in your community as well as the services and the sources of reliable information that are available during the health emergency (e.g. home deliveries, psychosocial support, health ministry website, alternative access to your pension).
Create a list of the basic supplies that you will need for at least two weeks and try to get these delivered where possible (e.g. non-perishable food items, household products, batteries for assistive devices you may use, and prescription medicines). Alternatively, ask family members, caregivers, neighbors or community leaders to help with ordering and/or delivery of groceries or prescription medicines. Make sure that your mobile phone credit is topped up and identify a safe place to charge your phone regularly so that you can keep in contact with family and friends and reach emergency services if needed.  
Make a list of emergency numbers (e.g. COVID-19 local helpline, nearby hospital and health emergencies numbers, hotline for victims of abuse, psychosocial support hotline) and support contacts (e.g. family members and friends, main caregiver, community care worker, associations of older persons). If you live alone, you may wish to share this list and ask your neighbors, family or caregiver to be in touch regularly, for example, by phone or video chat.
Discuss with your health-care worker how your health needs can be addressed during COVID-19. This may involve postponing non-urgent appointments, talking to your doctor or health-care worker by phone or video chat instead of in person and/or revising your vaccination schedule.
If you rely on the support provided by a caregiver, identify with him or her another person that you trust to support your daily living and care needs in case your caregiver is unable to continue to provide care. Together, you can note down all the personal care and assistance that you require and how it should be provided and share it with this trusted person so that they can be ready to provide care in case of need. 
If you are the primary caregiver of another person who is care dependent (e.g. grandchild, older spouse, child with a disability), identify a person that you and the person that you care for trust to take on your caregiving responsibilities in case you fall sick. Local authorities or volunteer organizations that provide support in these situations in your community might be able to help.
If multiple people live in your home, if possible, prepare a separate room or space in your home so that anyone showing symptoms compatible with COVID-19 can be isolated from others. If you do not have space for self-isolation, contact your community leaders or local health authorities to see if there is community space that could help you or other household members self-isolate.
Think about what matters most to you regarding care and support, including medical treatment, in case something happens to you and you are unable to make your own decisions. If you want to develop an advanced care plan to record your treatment and care wishes, you can talk about it with your health-care worker or someone that you trust. You can write down your wishes and  share them with people you trust.

289,289,"How can I keep healthy on a daily basis during the COVID-19 pandemic?
","You can follow these 10 steps to keep healthy during the COVID-19 pandemic.
Keep to your regular routines as much as possible and maintain a daily schedule for yourself including sleeping, meals and activities.
 Stay socially connected. Speak to loved ones and people you trust every day or as much as possible, using the telephone, video-calls or messaging, through writing letters, etc. Use this time to share your feelings and to do common hobbies together.
Be physically active every day. Reduce long periods of sitting and set up a daily routine that includes at least 30 minutes of exercise. Make sure to do activities that are safe and appropriate for your level of physical fitness as indicated by your health-care worker. You can use household chores as a way to keep physically active, follow an on-line class (e.g. Tai Chi, yoga) or choose your favorite music and dance to that.
Drink water and eat healthy and well-balanced meals. This will keep you hydrated, help strengthen your immune system and lower the risk of chronic illnesses and infectious diseases.
Avoid smoking and drinking alcohol. Smokers are likely to be more vulnerable to COVID-19 because smoking can affect lung capacity and because the act of smoking increases the possibility of transmission of virus from hand to mouth. Drinking alcohol not only disturbs your sleep but may also increase your risk of falls, weaken your immune system, and interact with any prescription medicines that you are taking. Limit the amount of alcohol you drink or don’t drink alcohol at all.
Take breaks from news coverage about COVID-19 as prolonged exposure can cause feelings of anxiety and despair. Seek updates at specific times of the day from a reliable source like the WHO website or national or local channels in order to help you distinguish facts from rumors or scams.
Engage in hobbies and activities that you enjoy or learn something new. Cognitive exercise such as reading a book or doing crosswords/Sudoku will keep your mind active and distract you from worrying. You can also use this time to keep a well-being diary .
If you have ongoing health conditions, take your prescribed medicines and follow the advice of your health-care worker regarding any health visits or phone consultations.
If you have an emergency medical condition that is not related to COVID-19, contact health emergencies immediately and ask what you should do next. Follow the instructions of the health-care worker.
If stress, worry, fear or sadness get in the way of your daily activities for several days in a row, seek psychosocial support from available services in your community.  If you are subject to abuse or violence from others, tell someone you trust and report this to the relevant authorities. You can also seek support from dedicated helplines that may be available in your country.

","If you present symptoms related to COVID-19, seek medical advice. Call by phone first if possible and give information about pre-existing health conditions and medicines that you are taking. Follow the instructions of the health-care worker and monitor your symptoms regularly.
If you have difficulty breathing, contact health emergencies immediately as this may be due to a respiratory infection. Call by phone first if possible to learn what to do next.
If you live with others, make sure that you isolate yourself as soon as you suspect infection by using the space that you identified in advance. You and other members of the household should also wear a medical mask as much as possible if these are available.
If you live with others and home care for COVID-19 is advised by your health-care worker, other household members should follow available guidance on home care for patients with COVID-19 presenting with mild symptoms and management of their contacts.
If you live alone and home care for COVID-10 is advised by your health-care worker, ask your family, friends, neighbors, health-care worker or a local volunteer organization to check in on you regularly and to provide support as needed following existing guidance for caregivers.
I have recently lost someone I care about. What advice do you have to help me cope?
 
Losing someone close to you is always hard, whatever the cause. During these extraordinary circumstances, when your usual routine may be disrupted and when funerals may not be permitted, it may be even harder. Following this advice may help.
Do not criticize yourself for how you feel. When you lose a family member or friend to COVID-19, you may experience a range of emotions.  You may also have difficulty sleeping or low levels of energy. All these feelings are normal and there is no right or wrong way to feel grief. 
Allow yourself time to process your emotions in response to your loss. You may think that the sadness and pain that you feel will never go away, but in most cases, these feelings lessen over time. 
Talk regularly with people that you trust about your feelings.
Keep to your routines as much as you feel able and try to focus on activities that bring you joy.
Seek advice and comfort from people that you trust (e.g. religious/faith leaders, mental health workers or other trusted members of your community) while maintaining physical distance (e.g. attending virtual mass).   
Think of alternative ways to say goodbye to the person who passed away such as writing a letter or dedicating a drawing to your loved one. These are small actions that can help you cope with grief and loss, particularly in situations where funeral services are not permitted.

","The role of children in transmission is not yet fully understood. To date, few outbreaks involving children or schools have been reported. However, the small number of outbreaks reported among teaching or associated staff to date suggests that spread of COVID-19 within educational settings may be limited.
As children generally have milder illness and fewer symptoms, cases may sometimes go unnoticed. Importantly, early data from studies suggest that infection rates among teenagers may be higher than in younger children.
Considering that many countries are starting to slowly lift restrictions on activities, the longer-term effects of keeping schools open on community transmission are yet to be evaluated. Some modeling studies suggest that school re-opening might have a small effect on wider transmission in the community, but this is not well understood. Further studies are underway on the role of children in transmission in and outside of educational settings. WHO is collaborating with scientists around the world to develop protocols that countries can use to study COVID-19 transmission in educational institutions.

294,294,"Should children with underlying health conditions (asthma, diabetes, obesity) return to school?
","Whether a child should go to school depends on their health condition, the current transmission of COVID-19 within their community, and the protective measures the school and community have in place to reduce the risk of COVID-19 transmission. While current evidence suggests that the risk of severe disease for children is lower overall than for adults, special precautions can be taken to minimize the risk of infection among children, and the benefits of returning to school should also be considered.
Current evidence suggests that people with underlying conditions such as chronic respiratory illness including asthma (moderate-to-severe), obesity, diabetes or cancer, are at higher risk of developing severe disease and death than people without other health conditions.

Several elements should be assessed in deciding to re-open schools or keep them open:
The epidemiology of COVID-19 at the local level: This may vary from one place to another within a country
Benefits and risks: what are the likely benefits and risks to children and staff of open schools? Including consideration of:
Transmission intensity in the area where the school operates: No cases, sporadic transmission; clusters transmission or community transmission.
Overall impact of school closures on education, general health and wellbeing; and on vulnerable and marginalized populations (e.g. girls, displaced or disabled).
Effectiveness of remote learning strategies.
Detection and response: Are the local health authorities able to act quickly?
The capacity of schools/educational institutions to operate safely.
Collaboration and coordination: Is the school collaborating with local public health authorities?
The range of other public health measures being implemented outside school.

299,299,"What are the prevention and control measures to be prepared and put in place in schools?
","There are several actions and requirements that should be reviewed and put in place to prevent the introduction and spread of COVID-19 in schools and into the community; and to ensure the safety of children and school staff while at school. Special provisions should be considered for early childhood development, higher learning institutions, residential schools or specialized institutions.
WHO recommends the following:
Community-level measures: Carry out early detection, testing, contact tracing and quarantine of contacts; investigate clusters; ensure physical distancing, hand and hygiene practices and age-appropriate mask use; shield vulnerable groups. Community-led initiatives such as addressing misleading rumors also play an important role in reducing the risk of infection.
Policy, practice and infrastructure: Ensure the necessary resources, policies and infrastructure are in place that protect the health and safety of all school personnel, including people at higher risk.
Behavioral aspects: Consider the age and capacity of students to understand and respect measures put in place. Younger children may find it more difficult to adhere to physical distancing or the appropriate use of masks.
Safety and security: School closure or re-opening may affect the safety and security of students and the most vulnerable children may require special attention, such as during pick-up and drop-off.
Hygiene and daily practices at the school and classroom level: Physical distancing of at least 1 meter between individuals including spacing of desks, frequent hand and respiratory hygiene, age-appropriate mask use, ventilation and environmental cleaning measures should be in place to limit exposure. Schools should educate staff and students on COVID-19 prevention measures, develop a schedule for daily cleaning and disinfection of the school environment, facilities and frequently touched surfaces, and ensure availability of hand hygiene facilities and national/local guidance on the use of masks.
Screening and care of sick students, teachers and other school staff: Schools should enforce the policy of “staying home if unwell”, waive the requirement for a doctor’s note, create a checklist for parents/students/staff to decide whether to go to school (taking into consideration the local situation), ensure students who have been in contact with a COVID-19 case stay home for 14 days, and consider options for screening on arrival.
Protection of individuals at high-risk: Schools should identify students and teachers at high-risk with pre-existing medical conditions to come up with strategies to keep them safe; maintain physical distancing and use of medical masks as well as frequent hand hygiene and respiratory etiquette.
Communication with parents and students: Schools should keep students and parents informed about the measures being implemented to ensure their collaboration and support.
Additional school-related measures such as immunization checks and catch-up vaccination programmes: Ensure continuity or expansion of essential services, including school feeding and mental health and psycho-social support.
Physical distancing outside classrooms: Maintain a distance of at least 1 meter for both students (all age groups) and staff, where feasible.
Physical distancing inside classrooms:
In areas with community transmission of COVID-19, maintain a distance of at least 1 meter between all individuals of all age groups, for any schools remaining open. This includes increasing desk spacing and staging recesses, breaks and lunch breaks; limiting the mixing of classes and of age groups; considering smaller classes or alternating attendance schedules, and ensuring good ventilation in classrooms.
In areas with cluster-transmission of COVID-19, a risk-based approach should be taken when deciding whether to keep a distance of at least 1 meter between students. Staff should always keep at least 1 meter apart from each other and from students and should wear a mask in situations where 1-meter distance is not practical.
In areas with sporadic cases/no cases of COVID-19, children under the age of 12 should not be required to keep physical distance at all times. Where feasible, children aged 12 and over should keep at least 1 meter apart from each other.  Staff should always keep at least 1 meter from each other and from students and should wear a mask in situations where 1-meter distance is not practical. Remote learning: Where children cannot attend classes in person, support should be given to ensure students have continued access to educational materials and technologies (internet, texting radio, radio, or television), (e.g. delivering assignments or broadcasting lessons). Shutting down educational facilities   should only be considered when no alternatives are available.
Checklist for parents/caregivers and community members
 
Monitor your child’s health and keep them home from school if they are ill.
Teach and model good hygiene practices for your children:
Wash your hands with soap and safe water frequently. If soap and water are not readily available, use an alcohol-based hand sanitizer with at least 60% alcohol. Always wash hands with soap and water, if hands are visibly dirty.
Ensure that safe drinking water is available and toilets or latrines are clean and available at home.
Ensure waste is safely collected, stored and disposed of.
Cough and sneeze into a tissue or your elbow and avoid touching your face, eyes, mouth and nose.
Encourage your children to ask questions and express their feelings with you and their teachers. Remember that your child may have different reactions to stress; be patient and understanding.
Prevent stigma by using facts and reminding students to be considerate of one another.
Coordinate with the school to receive information and ask how you can support school safety efforts (though parent-teacher committees, etc),.
 
Checklist for students and children
 
In a situation like this it is normal to feel sad, worried, confused, scared or angry. Know that you are not alone and talk to someone you trust, like your parents or teacher so that you can help keep yourself and your school safe and healthy.
Ask questions, educate yourself and get information from reliable sources.
Protect yourself and others:
Wash your hands frequently, always with soap and water for at least 20 seconds.
Remember to not touch your face, eyes, nose and mouth.
Do not share cups, eating utensils, food or drinks with others.
Be a leader in keeping yourself, your school, family and community healthy.
Share what you learn about preventing disease with your family and friends, especially with younger children.
Model good practices such as sneezing or coughing into your elbow and washing your hands, especially for younger family members.
Don’t stigmatize your peers or tease anyone about being sick; remember that the virus doesn’t follow geographical boundaries, ethnicities, age or ability or gender.
Tell your parents, another family member, or a caregiver if you feel sick, and ask to stay home.

301,301,"Does WHO recommend staff and children to wear masks at school? And if yes, what type of masks?
","In countries or areas where there is intense community transmission of COVID-19 and in settings where physical distancing cannot be achieved, the following criteria for use of masks in schools are recommended:
1. Children aged 5 years and under should not be required to wear masks.
2. For children between six and 11 years of age, a risk-based approach should be applied to the decision to use a mask, considering:
intensity of transmission in the area where the child is and evidence on the risk of infection and transmission in this age group.
beliefs, customs and behaviors.
the child’s capacity to comply with the correct use of masks and availability of adult supervision.
potential impact of mask wearing on learning and development.
additional considerations such as sport activities or for children with disabilities or underlying diseases.
3. Children and adolescents 12 years or older should follow the national mask guidelines for adults.
4. Teacher and support staff may be required to wear masks when they cannot guarantee at least a 1-meter distance from others or there is widespread transmission in the area.
Types of mask:
Fabric masks are recommended to prevent onward transmission in the general population in public areas, particularly where distancing is not possible, and in areas of community transmission. This could include the school grounds in some situations. Masks may help to protect others, because wearers may be infected before symptoms of illness appear. The policy on wearing a mask or face covering should be in line with national or local guidelines. Where used, masks should be worn, cared for and disposed of properly. 
The use of masks by children and adolescents in schools should only be considered as one part of a strategy to limit the spread of COVID-19.

304,304,"What is serology?
","‘Serology’ is the study of antibodies in blood serum.  
‘Antibodies’ are part of the body’s immune response to infection. Antibodies that work against SARS-CoV-2 – the virus that causes COVID-19 – are usually detectable in the first few weeks after infection. The presence of antibodies indicates that a person was infected with SARS-CoV-2, irrespective of whether the individual had severe or mild disease, or no symptoms.
‘Seroprevalence studies’ are conducted to measure the extent of infection, as measured by antibody levels, in a population under study. With any new virus, including SARS-CoV-2, initial seroprevalence in the population is assumed to be low or non-existent due to the fact that the virus has not circulated before.

305,305,What is the difference between molecular testing and serologic testing?,"‘Molecular testing’, including polymerase-chain reaction (PCR) testing, detects genetic material of the virus and so can detect if a person is currently infected with SARS-CoV-2.
‘Serologic testing’ detects antibodies against a virus, measuring the amount of antibodies produced following infection, thereby detecting if a person has previously been infected by SARS-CoV-2. Serologic tests should not be used to diagnose acute SARS-CoV-2 infection, as antibodies develop a few weeks after infection.

306,306,"What is the purpose of serologic testing?
","When a new disease, like COVID-19 emerges, initial surveillance and testing strategies focus initially on patients with severe disease and the use of molecular testing to measure acute infections, as these are the individuals who seek and require health care. This can often miss the fraction of mild or asymptomatic infections that do not require medical attention, and as such, the full extent of infection is not known early in an outbreak.
Serologic testing helps retrospectively determine the size of an outbreak or extent of infection in a population under study. Seroprevalence studies give a more complete picture of how much of a population has been infected with SARS-CoV-2 and will capture unrecognized cases not identified through routine or active surveillance.

","There are many studies underway to better understand the antibody response following infection to SARS-CoV-2.  Several studies to date show that most people who have been infected with SARS-CoV-2 develop antibodies specific to this virus. However, the levels of these antibodies can vary between those who have severe disease (higher levels of antibodies) and those with milder disease or asymptomatic infection (lower levels of antibodies).

310,310,What is herd immunity?,"Herd immunity', also known as 'population immunity', is the indirect protection from an infectious disease that happens when a population is immune either through vaccination or immunity developed through previous infection. WHO supports achieving 'herd immunity' through vaccination, not by allowing a disease to spread through any segment of the population, as this would result in unnecessary cases and deaths.
Herd immunity against COVID-19 should be achieved by protecting people through vaccination, not by exposing them to the pathogen that causes the disease. Vaccines train our immune systems to create proteins that fight disease, known as ‘antibodies’, just as would happen when we are exposed to a disease but – crucially – vaccines work without making us sick. Vaccinated people are protected from getting the disease in question and passing on the pathogen, breaking any chains of transmission. To safely achieve herd immunity against COVID-19, a substantial proportion of a population would need to be vaccinated, lowering the overall amount of virus able to spread in the whole population. One of the aims of working towards herd immunity is to keep vulnerable groups who cannot get vaccinated (e.g. due to health conditions like allergic reactions to the vaccine) safe and protected from the disease.The percentage of people who need to be immune in order to achieve herd immunity varies with each disease. For example, herd immunity against measles requires about 95% of a population to be vaccinated. The remaining 5% will be protected by the fact that measles will not spread among those who are vaccinated. For polio, the threshold is about 80%. The proportion of the population that must be vaccinated against COVID-19 to begin inducing herd immunity is not known. This is an important area of research and will likely vary according to the community, the vaccine, the populations prioritized for vaccination, and other factors.  
Achieving herd immunity with safe and effective vaccines makes diseases rarer and saves lives. 
COVID-19 and influenza (flu) are both infectious respiratory diseases, and they share some similar symptoms. However, they are caused by different viruses, and there are some differences in who is most vulnerable to severe disease. There are also differences in how the diseases are treated. It is important to know the difference between COVID-19 and influenza to better protect yourself. This Q&A will help you know the facts about COVID-19 and influenza and make informed decisions about your health.","['infecti', 'popul', 'diseas', 'threshold', 'immun', 'spread', 'protect', 'known', 'vari', 'would', 'expo', 'polio', 'measl', 'make', 'vulner', 'rarer', 'influenza', 'covid', 'know', 'segment', 'safe', 'induc', 'differ', 'vaccin', 'pathogen', 'happen', 'achiev', 'proport', 'fact', 'herd']"
311,311,How are COVID-19 and influenza viruses similar?,"1. COVID-19 and influenza are both respiratory diseases.
Both viruses share similar symptoms, including cough, runny nose, sore throat, fever, headache and fatigue. People may have varying levels of illness with both COVID-19 and influenza. Some may have no symptoms, mild symptoms or severe disease. Both influenza and COVID-19 can be fatal.
2. COVID-19 and influenza spread in similar ways.
Both COVID-19 and influenza are spread by droplets and aerosols when an infected person coughs, sneezes, speaks, sings or breathes. The droplets and aerosols can land in the eyes, nose or mouth of people who are nearby -- typically within 1 meter of the infected person, but sometimes even further away. People can also get infected with both COVID-19 and influenza by touching contaminated surfaces, then touching their eyes, nose or mouth without cleaning their hands.  
3. Some of the same groups have a higher risk for severe illness from COVID-19 and influenza.
While all age groups can be infected with both the COVID-19 virus and influenza virus, these people are at higher risk for severe disease and death from both COVID-19 and influenza:
older adults;
people of any age with chronic medical conditions (such as chronic cardiac, pulmonary, renal, metabolic, neurologic, liver or hematologic diseases); and
people with immunosuppressive conditions (such as HIV/AIDS, patients receiving chemotherapy or steroids, or malignancy)
Healthcare workers are at high risk of getting infected by COVID-19 and at high risk of getting infected by influenza.
Pregnant people and those who have recently given birth are at high risk for experiencing severe influenza and severe COVID-19.  
4. The same protective measures are effective against COVID-19 and influenza.
To protect against COVID-19 and influenza, follow these public health and social measures:
Maintain at least a 1-meter distance from others and wear a well-fitted mask when that’s not possible;
Avoid crowded and poorly ventilated places and settings;
Open windows or doors to keep rooms well ventilated;
Cough or sneeze into a bent elbow or tissue and throw the tissue into a closed bin;
Clean your hands frequently
Avoid touching your eyes, nose and mouth;
Stay home if you don’t feel well; and
Contact your medical provider if you have any of the following severe severe symptoms of COVID-19, including:
Shortness of breath,
Loss of appetite,
Confusion,
Persistent pain or pressure in the chest,
High temperature (above 38 °C)
Vaccination is an important part of preventing severe disease and death for both COVID-19 and influenza. Follow the advice of your local authorities on getting the influenza and COVID-19 vaccines. WHO recommends the influenza vaccine for older individuals, young children, pregnant people, people with underlying health conditions, and health workers.
COVID-19 vaccines are safe for most people 18 years and older, including those with pre-existing conditions of any kind, including auto-immune disorders. These conditions include: hypertension, diabetes, asthma, pulmonary, liver and kidney disease, as well as chronic infections that are stable and controlled.
If supplies are limited in your area, discuss your situation with your care provider if you:
Have a compromised immune system
Are pregnant or nursing your baby
Have a history of severe allergies, particularly to a vaccine (or any of the ingredients in the vaccine)
Are severely frail
People with mild symptoms of both COVID-19 and influenza can usually be cared for safely at home. 
5. There are safe and effective vaccines for both COVID-19 and influenza.
COVID-19 vaccines have been proven to protect against severe illness and death caused by COVID-19 disease. Millions of people around the world have safely received COVID-19 vaccines, and the vaccines have met rigorous standards for safety, effectiveness and quality. Getting vaccinated may also protect the people around you. If you are protected from getting COVID-19, you are less likely to infect someone else. COVID-19 vaccines do not protect against influenza.
WHO recommends vaccinations each year to prevent severe influenza disease in high-risk groups: pregnant people, individuals with underlying health conditions, older adults, health workers, and young children.

312,312,How are COVID-19 and influenza viruses different?,"1. Treatments for COVID-19 and influenza are different.
The treatment options in use for COVID-19 at medical facilities include oxygen, corticosteroids, and IL6 receptor blockers for severely ill patients. Treatment for people with severe respiratory illness includes advanced respiratory support such as the use of ventilators. Several other treatment options for COVID-19 are currently in clinical trials.
Antiviral drugs for influenza can reduce severe complications and death, and they are especially important for high-risk groups. It’s important to remember that antibiotics are not effective against influenza or COVID-19 viruses.
People with mild symptoms of both diseases can usually be treated safely at home.
2. Vaccines for COVID-19 and flu are different.
Vaccines developed for COVID-19 do not protect against influenza, and similarly, the flu vaccine does not protect against COVID-19.

If you don’t feel well or show any symptoms of COVID-19, stay home.
If you choose to attend a gathering, practice prevention measures, regardless of your COVID-19 vaccination status:  
keep at least a 1 meter distance from others;
wear a mask;

What steps can I take to make the event as safe as possible for my guests?,"If you are unable to postpone your event, consider hosting it in a well-ventilated outdoor space. The virus that causes COVID-19 spreads easily indoors, especially in poorly ventilated settings. Outdoor venues are safer than indoor spaces.
Make your event as safe as possible for guests. Keep it small and short. Encourage people to wear masks and ensure enough space for each guest to maintain at least a 1-meter distance from others. Help your guests follow COVID-19 prevention measures: provide masks, alcohol-based hand sanitizer or access to soap and water, tissues and bins with lids that close.

318,318,Why was the use of hydroxychloroquine stopped in the Solidarity Trial?,"On 17 June 2020, WHO announced that the hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) arm of the Solidarity Trial to find an effective COVID-19 treatment was being stopped. 
The trial's Executive Group and principal investigators made the decision based on evidence from the Solidarity trial, UK's Recovery trial and a Cochrane review of other evidence on hydroxychloroquine.
Data from Solidarity (including the French Discovery trial data) and the recently announced results from the UK's Recovery trial both showed that hydroxychloroquine does not result in the reduction of mortality of hospitalized COVID-19 patients, when compared with standard of care.","['french', 'reduct', 'june', 'mortal', 'princip', 'announc', 'find', 'result', 'recent', 'evid', 'hospit', 'execut', 'standard', 'made', 'review', 'compar', 'recoveri', 'arm', 'discoveri', 'decis', 'trial', 'investig', 'data', 'hcq', 'hydroxychloroquin', 'show', 'cochran', 'solidar', 'uk', 'stop']"
319,319,What will happen to the people who were already enrolled in the hydroxychloroquine arm of the trial?," 
Investigators will not randomize further patients to hydroxychloroquine in the Solidarity trial. Patients who have already started hydroxychloroquine but who have not yet finished their course in the trial may complete their course or stop at the discretion of the supervising physician. 
The use of hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine are accepted as generally safe for use in patients with autoimmune diseases or malaria.","['diseas', 'aadhaar', 'physician', 'random', 'finish', 'supervis', 'chloroquin', 'peopl', 'may', 'cours', 'patient', 'discret', 'arm', 'yet', 'complet', 'enrol', 'autoimmun', 'alreadi', 'trial', 'investig', 'malaria', 'use', 'safe', 'happen', 'start', 'gener', 'hydroxychloroquin', 'solidar', 'accept', 'stop']"
320,320,What is WHO’s view of the use of hydroxychloroquine in pre or post-exposure prophylaxis?,The decision to stop hydroxychloroquine’s use in the Solidarity trial does not apply to the use or evaluation of hydroxychloroquine in pre or post-exposure prophylaxis in patients exposed to COVID-19.,"['aadhaar', 'abroad', 'prophylaxi', 'absenc', 'post', 'evalu', 'aarogya', 'abattoir', 'abhishek', 'abnorm', 'abid', 'exposur', 'abridg', 'patient', 'appli', 'expo', 'view', 'pre', 'decis', 'trial', 'covid', 'abdomin', 'use', 'abil', 'abl', 'hydroxychloroquin', 'solidar', 'abruptli', 'stop', 'abort']"
321,321,What is the Solidarity Trial?,"The Solidarity Trial is an international clinical trial to help find an effective treatment for COVID-19, launched by WHO and partners. It is hoped that one or more of the treatments under trial will result in improving clinical outcomes in COVID-19 patients and save lives. Other trials are on-going around the world in addition to the Solidarity Trial. 
The treatment options are: Remdesivir; Lopinavir/Ritonavir; and Lopinavir/Ritonavir with Interferon beta-1a. The treatment options were originally selected based on evidence from laboratory, animal and clinical studies. Hydroxychloroquine was originally included in the trial but this arm was stopped, as of 17 June 2020, as evidence showed it did not result in the reduction of mortality of hospitalized COVID-19 patients, when compared with standard of care.
Over 100 countries have expressed an interest in participating in the trial and WHO is actively supporting more than 60 of them, including with the following:
ethical and regulatory approvals of the WHO core protocol;
identification of hospitals participating in the trial;
training of hospital clinicians on the web-based randomization and data system;
shipping the trial drugs as requested by each participating country.
As of 3 June 2020, more than 3500 patients have been recruited in 35 countries, with over 400 hospitals actively recruiting patients.

322,322,What is physical activity?,"Physical activity includes all forms of active recreation, sports participation, cycling and walking, as well as activities you do at work and around the home and garden. It doesn’t have to be exercise or sport – play, dance, gardening, and even house cleaning and carrying heavy shopping is all part of being physically active.
During the COVID-19 pandemic, when so many of us are very restricted in our movements, it is even more important for people of all ages and abilities to be as active as possible. Even a short break from sitting, by doing 3-5 minutes of physical movement, such as walking or stretching, will help ease muscle strain, relieve mental tension and improve blood circulation and muscle activity. Regular physical activity can also help to give the day a routine and be a way of staying in contact with family and friends.","['even', 'ea', 'exercis', 'mental', 'regular', 'help', 'walk', 'recreat', 'physic', 'friend', 'routin', 'reliev', 'hous', 'activ', 'danc', 'minut', 'tension', 'cycl', 'give', 'movement', 'shop', 'garden', 'abil', 'heavi', 'stretch', 'sport', 'sit', 'form', 'break', 'muscl']"
323,323,Why do we need physical actvity during COVID-19? ,"Regular physical activity benefits both the body and mind. It can reduce high blood pressure, help manage weight and reduce the risk of heart disease, stroke, type 2 diabetes, and various cancers. It also improves bone and muscle strength and increases balance, flexibility and fitness. For older people, activities that improve balance help to prevent falls and injuries. For children, regular physical activity helps support healthy growth and development and reduce the risk of disease in later life, and through regular activity, children can develop fundamental movement skills and build social relationships.
Regular physical activity also improves mental health and can reduce the risk of depression, cognitive decline and delay the onset of dementia - and improve overall feelings of wellbeing.

324,324,How much physical activity is recommended?,"WHO has detailed recommendations on the amount of physical activity people of all ages should do to benefit their health and wellbeing. Here are the minimum levels we recommend:
Infants under the age of 1 year need to
be physically active several times a day.
Children under 5 years of age
should spend at least 180 minutes a day in physical activities, with 3-4 year-olds being moderately or vigorously active for an hour a day.
Children and adolescents aged 5-17years
all children and adolescents should do at least 60 minutes a day of moderate to vigorous-intensity physical activity, including activities that strengthen muscle and bone, at least 3 days per week.
Adults aged 18 years and over
should do a total of at least 150 minutes of moderate-intensity physical activity throughout the week, or at least 75 minutes of vigorous-intensity physical activity throughout the week, including muscle-strengthening activities 2 or more days per week.
older adults with poor mobility should do physical activity to enhance balance and prevent falls on 3 or more days per week.
 But any physical activity is better than none.  Start with small amounts and gradually increase duration, frequency and intensity over time.
Being active during the COVID-19 pandemic is challenging for us all.  Because the opportunities to be physically active seem to be more restricted, it is even more important to plan in every day the ways to be active and to reduce the time spent sitting for long periods. Put simply, it is a critical time to ensure we all move more and sit less.

325,325,So how do I stay safe while exercising in COVID-19?,"Do not exercise if you have a fever, cough and difficulty breathing. Stay home and rest, seek medical attention and call in advance. Follow the directions of your local health authority.
If you are able to go for a walk or bicycle ride, always practise physical distance and wash your hands with water and soap before you leave, when you get to where you are going, and as soon as you get home.  If water and soap are not immediately available, use alcohol-based hand rub.
If you go to a park or public open space to walk, run or exercise, always practise physical distance and wash your hands with water and soap, before you leave, when you get to where you are going, and as soon as you get home.  If water and soap are not immediately available, use alcohol-based hand rub. Follow the directions of your local health authority in regards to any restrictions on the number of people with you and/or restrictions on the use of public outdoor play or exercise equipment.
If you are not regularly active, start slowly and with low intensity activities, like walking and low impact exercises. Start with shorter amounts, like 5-10 minutes, and gradually build up to 30 minutes or more continuously over a few weeks. It is better and safer to be active for short periods more frequently than to try and be active for long periods when you are not used to it.
Choose the right activity so that you reduce the risk of injury and that you enjoy the activity. Choose the right intensity according to your health status and fitness level. You should be able to breathe comfortably and hold a conversation while you do light- and moderate-intensity physical activity.","['exercis', 'period', 'hand', 'walk', 'home', 'breath', 'physic', 'soon', 'restrict', 'immedi', 'leav', 'practis', 'activ', 'minut', 'intens', 'rub', 'direct', 'water', 'get', 'soap', 'choos', 'wash', 'go', 'alway', 'use', 'abl', 'start', 'alcohol', 'right', 'low']"
326,326,How do I stay active in and around the home?,"Try and reduce long periods of time spent sitting, whether for work, studying, watching TV, reading, or using social media or playing games using screens. Reduce sitting for long periods by taking short 3-5 minute breaks every 20-30 minutes. Simply stand up and stretch or even better, take a walk around the house, up and down the stairs, or into the garden. By just moving around and stretching you can improve your health and wellbeing. Set up a regular routine to be active every day, by planning a physical activity or exercise break either by yourself, by joining an online class, or by setting up a time to be active online with your friends or colleagues. Making a specific time to be active helps ensure you get your daily physical activity. Put the time in your diary, and it will help remind you. Stick with it, as this will help you build a regular routine, and help you adjust to new ways of working, study and family life under COVID-19 restrictions
Be active with your family and friends, connecting with others can help you and your family in the home and elsewhere spend time together and be active. Planning time to be active with your children with active games at home, walks in the parks, or cycling can be a way the whole family can relax, be together and be active and healthy whilst at home.  
Set yourself and your family Be Active goals, by choosing a specific type of activity, time of day and/or number of minutes you will do every day. Get each family member to choose their own goal which sets a bit of a challenge but is realistic with help from family or friends and motivation. Record your progress on a weekly activity chart and, if you think it would help, reward yourself with something you value.

Food buffets are not recommended because of the risk of close physical contact with others, shared serving implements and multiple people touching the surfaces on the buffet. Indoor dining spaces should have a maximum of 4 people in 10 square meters. The distance from the back of one chair to the back of another chair should be at least 1 meter apart for both indoor and outdoor dining, and guests that face each other should also be at this distance.

330,330,Is it safe to use fans or air conditioning in an accommodation?,"Ventilation is an important factor in preventing the virus that causes COVID-19 from spreading. Recirculated air from split air conditioning units, fan coils or any system that runs with a recirculation mode should be avoided where possible, unless in a single occupancy room with no one else present. If recirculation is unavoidable, increase outdoor air exchange by opening windows, if possible and safe to do so, and minimize air blowing from one person directly to another.

333,333,"As a smoker, am I likely to get more severe symptoms if I get COVID-19?","Tobacco compromises lung function, and COVID-19 primarily affects the lungs. Smoking tobacco is also a known risk factor for severe disease from many respiratory infections, including coronaviruses SARS (first identified in 2003) and MERS-CoV (first documented in June 2012). Smoking also impairs the immune system and previous studies have established that tobacco use is linked with poorer outcomes for people with TB and pneumonia.
Evidence indicates that smokers are more likely to suffer more severe outcomes of COVID-19, such as admission into intensive care units and death, than never smokers.  Furthermore, severe forms of COVID-19 or deaths due to COVID-19 are more frequent in people with comorbidities that are related to tobacco use, including COPD, lung cancer and cardiovascular diseases. There is currently only limited information on COVID-19 in relation to other tobacco products (e.g. heated tobacco products, waterpipe, cigars) and electronic nicotine delivery systems (e.g. e-cigarettes), although these products are thought to play an unfavorable role in COVID-19 severity.","['product', 'cardiovascular', 'suffer', 'unfavor', 'impair', 'admiss', 'mer', 'smoke', 'poorer', 'pneumonia', 'sever', 'cigar', 'death', 'relat', 'electron', 'never', 'lung', 'outcom', 'cigarett', 'nicotin', 'heat', 'primarili', 'covid', 'first', 'waterpip', 'system', 'furthermor', 'smoker', 'tobacco', 'copd']"

349,349,What is meant by “essential travel”?,"As part of public health efforts to stop the spread of COVID-19, travel may be limited or restricted to travel deemed to be essential. Essential travel is defined differently by national authorities in different countries.
Essential travel may include travel for emergencies and humanitarian activities (including emergency medical flights and medical evacuation). It may include travel taken by essential personnel (including emergency responders and those who provide public health technical support, and critical personnel in transport and security sectors, such as seafarers and diplomatic officers). Essential travel may also include repatriations to home countries, as well as cargo transport needed to deliver essential supplies such as food, medicines, and fuel.

Be sure to follow COVID-19 prevention measures, such as wearing a mask, washing hands frequently, maintaining physical distance of at least 1 meter, and avoiding crowded places and poorly ventilated settings whenever possible. If you are in a high-risk group and must travel, wear a medical-grade face mask at all times and step up your prevention practices.
People aged 60 and over, and those with serious chronic diseases or underlying health conditions, should postpone or delay travel internationally to and from areas with community transmission unless they have been fully vaccinated at least two weeks prior to their travel, or have immunity from a recent infection within 6 months prior to traveling.

359,359,How can ventilation reduce the risk of contracting COVID-19 in airplanes?,"Some airplanes have cabin air filtration systems equipped with HEPA filters which can remove viruses and germs quickly, minimizing the duration of the exposure to any potential infectious materials produced by a cough or sneeze. The cabin air system is designed to operate most efficiently by delivering approximately 50 percent outside air and 50 percent filtered, recirculated air. The air supply is essentially sterile and particle-free.  However, adequate ventilation is just one of the preventive measures to reduce the risk of COVID-19 transmission.  Other important measures include maintaining a physical distance of at least 1 meter whenever possible, frequent hand hygiene and wearing a mask. Passengers should check with the airline company and the national or local guidelines about when and where to wear a mask while flying.","['percent', 'hepa', 'mask', 'cabin', 'remov', 'ventil', 'reduc', 'passeng', 'steril', 'deliv', 'recircul', 'minim', 'fli', 'risk', 'air', 'free', 'durat', 'germ', 'filtrat', 'wear', 'filter', 'airlin', 'airplan', 'effici', 'oper', 'particl', 'system', 'approxim', 'compani', 'measur']"
360,360,What should I do if I get sick while traveling?,"If you become ill during your travel, inform your travel attendant (plane, ship, train, etc.). You may be moved to a seat farther away from others.
Ask for information on how to be seen by a health care provider and seek care immediately.
Wear a mask continuously while you travel, frequently clean your hands with hand sanitizer, cover a cough or sneeze with a bent elbow or tissue, and maintain at least a 1 meter distance from others wherever possible. You should stop traveling as soon as feasible.
If you are told you must quarantine or self-isolate yourself in a specific place, you should be provided with free, appropriate facilities and care, and not be asked to stay longer than 14 days.

361,361,"Are people with tuberculosis likely to be at increased risk of COVID-19 infection, illness and death?","While experience on COVID-19 infection in tuberculosis (TB) patients remains limited, it is anticipated that people ill with both TB and COVID-19 may have poorer treatment outcomes, especially if TB treatment is interrupted.
Older age, diabetes and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) are linked with more severe COVID-19 and are also risk factors for poor outcomes in TB.
TB patients should take precautions as advised by health authorities to be protected from COVID-19 and continue their TB treatment as prescribed.
People ill with COVID-19 and TB show similar symptoms such as cough, fever and difficulty breathing. Both diseases attack primarily the lungs and although both biological agents transmit mainly via close contact, the incubation period from exposure to disease in TB is longer, often with a slow onset.","['via', 'diseas', 'agent', 'attack', 'mainli', 'incub', 'pulmonari', 'biolog', 'obstruct', 'prescrib', 'poorer', 'ill', 'longer', 'anticip', 'interrupt', 'peopl', 'risk', 'patient', 'although', 'tb', 'slow', 'outcom', 'treatment', 'onset', 'primarili', 'covid', 'tuberculosi', 'poor', 'link', 'copd']"
362,362,Do COVID-19 and tuberculosis spread in the same way?,"While both tuberculosis (TB) and COVID-19 spread by close contact between people the exact mode of transmission differs, explaining some differences in infection control measures to mitigate the two conditions.
TB bacilli remain suspended in the air in droplet nuclei for several hours after a TB patient coughs, sneezes, shouts, or sings, and people who inhale them can get infected. The size of these droplet nuclei is a key factor determining their infectiousness. Their concentration decreases with ventilation and exposure to direct sunlight.
COVID-19 transmission has primarily been attributed to the direct breathing of droplets expelled by someone with COVID-19 (people may be infectious before clinical features become apparent). Droplets produced by coughing, sneezing, exhaling and speaking may land on objects and surfaces, and contacts can get infected with COVID-19 by touching them and then touching their eyes, nose or mouth . Handwashing, in addition to respiratory precautions, are thus important in the control of COVID-19.

363,363,What is the potential impact of COVID-19 pandemic on essential tuberculosis services?,"Modeling work suggests that if the COVID-19 pandemic led to a global reduction of 25% in expected TB detection for 3 months – a realistic possibility given the levels of disruption in TB services being observed in multiple countries – then we would expect a 13% increase in TB deaths, bringing us back to the levels of TB mortality that we had 5 years ago. This may even be a conservative estimate as it does not factor in other possible impacts of the pandemic on TB transmission, treatment interruptions and poorer outcomes in people with TB and COVID-19 infection . Between 2020 and 2025 an additional 1.4 million TB deaths could be registered as a direct consequence of the COVID-19 pandemic .
All measures should be taken to ensure continuity of services for people who need preventive and curative treatment for tuberculosis (TB).

364,364,What should health authorities do to provide sustainability of essential tuberculosis services during the COVID-19 pandemic?,"People-centered delivery of tuberculosis (TB) prevention, diagnosis, treatment and care services should be ensured in tandem with the COVID-19 response.
Prevention: Measures must be implemented to limit transmission of TB and COVID-19 in congregate settings and health care facilities. Administrative, environmental and personal protection measures apply to both (e.g. basic infection prevention and control, cough etiquette, patient triage).
Provision of TB preventive treatment should be maintained as much as possible.
Diagnosis: Tests for TB and COVID-9 are different and both should be made available for individuals with respiratory symptoms, which may be similar for the two diseases.
Treatment and care: People-centered outpatient and community-based care should be strongly preferred over hospital treatment for TB patients (unless serious conditions require hospitalization) to reduce opportunities for transmission.
Anti-TB treatment, in line with the latest WHO guidelines, must be provided for all TB patients, including those in quarantine and those with confirmed COVID-19 disease. Adequate stocks of TB medicines should be provided to all patients to reduce trips to collect medicines.
Use of digital health technologies for patients and programmes should be intensified. In line with WHO recommendations, technologies like electronic medication monitors and video-supported therapy can help patients complete their TB treatment.","['outpati', 'stock', 'anti', 'trip', 'medicin', 'reduc', 'care', 'video', 'line', 'congreg', 'intensifi', 'hospit', 'electron', 'patient', 'tb', 'diagnosi', 'center', 'tandem', 'treatment', 'health', 'covid', 'tuberculosi', 'strongli', 'must', 'triag', 'prevent', 'provid', 'measur', 'servic', 'technolog']"
365,365,How can health authorities ensure supplies of tuberculosis medicines and diagnostics?,"Appropriate planning and monitoring are essential to ensure that procurement and supply of tuberculosis (TB) medicines and diagnostics are not interrupted.
WHO is monitoring medicine supply at the global level, while The Global Fund, the Stop TB Partnership Global Drug Facility (GDF), USAID, Unitaid and other donors play an essential role in supporting countries to secure adequate and sustainable supplies of TB medicines, drugs and diagnostics.

366,366,What services can be leveraged across both diseases?,"The response to COVID-19 can benefit from the capacity building efforts developed for tuberculosis (TB) over many years of investment by national authorities and donors. These include infection prevention and control, contact tracing, household and community-based care, and surveillance and monitoring systems.
Although modes of transmission of the two diseases are slightly different, administrative, environmental and personal protection measures apply to both (e.g. basic infection prevention and control, cough etiquette, patient triage).
TB laboratory networks have been established in countries with the support of WHO and international partners. These networks as well as specimen transportation mechanisms could also be used for COVID-19 diagnosis and surveillance.
Respiratory physicians, pulmonology staff of all grades, TB specialists and health workers at the primary health care level may be points of reference for patients with pulmonary complications of COVID-19. They should familiarize themselves with the most current WHO recommendations for the supportive treatment and containment of COVID-19.
TB programme staff with their experience and capacity, including in active case finding and contact tracing, are well placed to support the COVID-19 response.

367,367,"What measures should be in place to protect staff working in tuberculosis laboratories and healthcare facilities, and community health workers, from COVID-19 infection?","Health care facilities, including those that diagnose and care for tuberculosis (TB) and lung diseases, are bound to receive patients with COVID-19, many of whom may be undiagnosed. Additional measures may be needed to avoid that staff in these centers are exposed to COVID-19 infection.
The Information Note includes additional, temporary measures that should be considered. These include alternative arrangements to reduce visits for TB follow-up, precautions for sputum collection, transportation and testing. The note also includes a description of ethical obligations in this setting.
Existing WHO recommendations for infection prevention and control for TB and for COVID-19 should be strictly implemented, including personal protection equipment.

368,368,How can we protect people seeking tuberculosis care during the COVID-19 pandemic?,"In a context of widespread restriction of movement of the population in response to the pandemic and isolation of COVID-19 patients, communication with the healthcare services should be maintained so that people with tuberculosis (TB), especially those most vulnerable, get essential services. This includes management of adverse drug reactions and co-morbidities, nutritional and mental health support, and restocking of the supplies of medicines.
Enough TB medicines will need to be dispensed to the patient or caregiver to last until the next visit. This will limit interruption or unnecessary visits to the clinic. Mechanisms to deliver medicines at home and even to collect specimens for follow-up testing may become expedient. Home-based TB treatment is bound to become more common. Alternative arrangements to reduce clinic visits may involve limiting appointments to specific times to avoid exposure to other clinic attendees; using digital technologies to maintain treatment support. Community health workers become more critical as treatment is more decentralized.
More TB patients will probably start their treatment at home and therefore limiting the risk of household transmission of TB during the first few weeks is important.
Vulnerable populations who have poor access to healthcare should not get further marginalized during the pandemic.","['becom', 'popul', 'support', 'commun', 'dispens', 'expedi', 'pandem', 'home', 'clinic', 'nutrit', 'restock', 'morbid', 'medicin', 'visit', 'healthcar', 'widespread', 'margin', 'interrupt', 'specimen', 'maintain', 'patient', 'tb', 'treatment', 'vulner', 'tuberculosi', 'attende', 'bound', 'limit', 'decentr', 'servic']"
369,369,Can tuberculosis and COVID-19 be tested on the same type of specimen?,"The diagnostic methods for tuberculosis (TB) and COVID-19 are quite distinct and commonly require different specimens.  
Sputum, as well as many other biological specimens, can be used to diagnose TB using culture or molecular techniques.
Tests for COVID-19 are done most commonly by nasopharyngeal or oropharyngeal swab or wash in ambulatory patients, but sputum or endotracheal aspirate or bronchoalveolar lavage may be used in patients with severe respiratory disease.  Molecular testing is the currently recommended method for the identification of infectious COVID-19 and just as for TB, serological assays are not recommended for the routine diagnosis of COVID-19.
The pipeline for COVID-19 diagnostics has flourished impressively within a few months. Amongst these is the Xpert® Xpress SARS-CoV-2 cartridge for use on GeneXpert machines, which are machines used in TB diagnosis. WHO is currently evaluating this cartridge as well as other tests. Additional resources to roll out COVID-19 testing should be mobilized rather than relying only on existing resources that are used for TB, to ensure that the diagnostic coverage for TB is maintained as necessary.","['amongst', 'machin', 'lavag', 'commonli', 'bronchoalveolar', 'test', 'resourc', 'diagnost', 'aspir', 'specimen', 'flourish', 'tb', 'diagnosi', 'techniqu', 'molecular', 'impress', 'genexpert', 'ambulatori', 'pipelin', 'method', 'endotrach', 'covid', 'tuberculosi', 'nasopharyng', 'use', 'sputum', 'xpress', 'cartridg', 'oropharyng', 'xpert']"
370,370,Should all people being evaluated for tuberculosis also be tested for COVID-19 and vice-versa?,"Testing of the same patient for both tuberculosis (TB) and COVID-19 would generally be indicated for three main reasons, subject to the specific setting in each country:
clinical features that are common to both diseases; or 
simultaneous exposure to both diseases; or
presence of a risk factor
As the pandemic advances, more people of all ages, including TB patients, will be exposed to COVID-19.

371,371,Is tuberculosis treatment different in people who have both TB and COVID-19?,"In most cases tuberculosis (TB) treatment is not different in people with or without COVID-19 infection.
Experience on joint management of both COVID-19 infection and TB remains limited. However, suspension of TB treatment in COVID-19 patients should be exceptional. TB preventive treatment, treatment for drug-susceptible or drug-resistant TB disease should continue uninterrupted to safeguard the patient’s health, reduce transmission and prevent the development of drug-resistance.
While treatment trials are ongoing, no medication is currently recommended for COVID-19 and therefore no cautions on drug-drug interactions are indicated at present. TB patients on treatment should nonetheless be asked if they are taking any medicines, including traditional cures, that may interact with their medication.
Effective treatments to prevent TB and to treat active TB have been scaled up and are in use worldwide. The risk of death in TB patients approaches 50% if left untreated and may be higher in the elderly or in the presence of comorbidity. It is critical that TB services are not disrupted during the COVID-19 response.
Gathering evidence as this pandemic unfolds will be very important, while upholding the norms of professional conduct and patient confidentiality when handling clinical details.","['nonetheless', 'cure', 'disrupt', 'drug', 'worldwid', 'safeguard', 'caution', 'untreat', 'patient', 'uninterrupt', 'tb', 'tradit', 'medic', 'confidenti', 'treatment', 'except', 'joint', 'covid', 'tuberculosi', 'suspens', 'comorbid', 'norm', 'differ', 'resist', 'interact', 'prevent', 'elderli', 'left', 'unfold', 'uphold']"
372,372,Does the BCG vaccine protect people from COVID-19?,"There is no evidence at this point that the Bacille Calmette-Guérin vaccine (BCG) protects people against infection with COVID-19 virus. Clinical trials addressing this question are underway, and WHO will evaluate the evidence when it is available. In the absence of evidence, WHO does not recommend BCG vaccination for the prevention of COVID-19. WHO continues to recommend reserving BCG for neonatal vaccination in settings with a high risk of tuberculosis.","['bacil', 'calmett', 'gu', 'clinic', 'point', 'avail', 'protect', 'peopl', 'risk', 'evalu', 'evid', 'bcg', 'question', 'address', 'rin', 'recommend', 'reserv', 'trial', 'continu', 'covid', 'tuberculosi', 'viru', 'vaccin', 'neonat', 'high', 'set', 'prevent', 'infect', 'underway', 'absenc']"
373,373,"As safe and effective vaccines for COVID-19 are approved, who should be the first to receive them?","WHO believes that everyone, everywhere who could benefit from safe and effective COVID-19 vaccines should have access as quickly as possible, starting with those at highest risk of serious disease or death. 
WHO’s Strategic Advisory Group of Experts on Immunization (SAGE) released two key documents to help guide the allocation and prioritization of populations to receive COVID-19 vaccines:
The Values Framework for the allocation and prioritization of COVID-19 vaccination, which offers high-level guidance globally on the values and ethical considerations regarding allocation of COVID-19 vaccines between countries, and offers guidance nationally on the prioritization of groups for vaccination within countries while supply is limited. 
The Roadmap for Prioritizing Population Groups for Vaccines against COVID-19, which recommends public health strategies and target priority groups for different levels of vaccine availability and epidemiologic settings. 
The SAGE Roadmap has now been updated and offers recommendations on how vaccines should be prioritized in countries with limited supply for maximum public health impact, taking into account the most recent evidence on COVID-19 vaccines and on the ongoing supply constraint issues faced by the COVAX Facility.  This update reflects data that has become available from clinical vaccine studies, as well as lessons learned from the early implementation of programmes.
The recommendations include expanding the groups included in Stage II of the prioritization roadmap to include pregnant women and children with underlying health conditions, and updates regarding clinical trials for lactating women. 
In addition, WHO led the development of a Fair Allocation Framework that aims to ensure that successful COVID-19 vaccines and treatments are shared equitably across all countries. This framework is a key part of the Access to COVID-19 Tools (ACT) Accelerator, a global collaboration to accelerate development, production, and equitable access to COVID-19 tests, treatments, and vaccines. The framework advises that as safe and effective COVID-19 vaccines are authorized for use, all countries should receive doses in proportion to their population size to immunize the highest-priority groups. In the second phase, vaccines would continue to be deployed to all countries so that additional populations can be covered according to national priorities.","['popul', 'group', 'framework', 'global', 'access', 'regard', 'guidanc', 'updat', 'sage', 'offer', 'suppli', 'alloc', 'key', 'covid', 'prioriti', 'receiv', 'woman', 'safe', 'roadmap', 'valu', 'limit', 'effect', 'vaccin', 'acceler', 'highest', 'equit', 'countri', 'recommend', 'constraint', 'priorit']"
374,374,What is WHO doing to ensure that COVID-19 vaccines will be allocated fairly?,"WHO is one of the leaders of a global alliance known as COVAX, the vaccine pillar of the ACT-Accelerator collaboration, which is working to accelerate the development and manufacturing of COVID-19 vaccines and ensure that there is fair and equitable access to these vaccines for all countries.
COVAX has allocated more than 170 million vaccines across 138 countries according to a framework developed by an expert group that includes ethicists, scientists, and other public health specialists  and vetted by WHO’s Member States. It continues to work to diversify both its portfolio of vaccines and channels for access to vaccines, Under this framework, COVID-19 vaccines are being rolled out in two phases. In the first phase, they have been allocated proportionally  to the population size to all participating countries at the same time, so as to protect those people at greatest risk of infection and of severe disease. In phase II, vaccines will be allocated to target countries with higher threat and vulnerability.
WHO’s Strategic Advisory Group of Experts (SAGE) has provided recommendations about which populations should be prioritized first. These include frontline health and care workers at high risk of infection, older adults, and those people at high risk of death because of underlying conditions like heart disease and diabetes. In the second phase of the roll-out, as more doses are produced, vaccines can go to groups less at risk of being infected or of suffering badly.
COVAX aims to provide at least 2 billion vaccine doses by the end of 2021 and 1.8 billion doses to 92 lower income economies by early 2022.
 The Facility has the possibility to increase those doses by another 1 billion as right of first refusal for several candidates in clinical trials supported by CEPI. Although these doses are not enough for everyone in all countries, it may be enough to end the acute stage of the crisis and put the world on the road to ending the pandemic.
The number of countries willing to donate vaccines has been increasing. It is important that they do so using the COVAX mechanism so the vaccines are allocated to countries that need them most. At least one billion doses could be donated by high income countries in 2021.
COVAX’s need for doses is greatest right now. Countries with higher coverage rates, which are due to receive doses soon, should swap their places in supply queues with COVAX so that doses can be equitably distributed as quickly as possible. COVAX continues to be in close dialogue with countries who have expressed interest in sharing doses with the Facility and expects further announcements on this to take place over the coming weeks and months.","['covax', 'group', 'ethicist', 'donat', 'roll', 'framework', 'greatest', 'badli', 'access', 'incom', 'risk', 'enough', 'phase', 'end', 'alloc', 'dialogu', 'expert', 'dose', 'first', 'diversifi', 'vaccin', 'allianc', 'higher', 'high', 'acceler', 'right', 'equit', 'countri', 'billion', 'facil']"
375,375,How is WHO helping countries prepare for COVID-19 vaccines rollouts?,"Along with accelerating COVID-19 vaccine research and helping scale up manufacturing capacity, WHO is working in close partnership with countries, regional colleagues, and other partners to develop needed policies, strengthen regulatory capacity, training courses, and guide countries in all the needed preparations for a programme to deliver COVID-19 vaccines. WHO, UNICEF, and partners are supporting countries in preparing for COVID-19 vaccine introduction. The Country Readiness and Delivery workstream – which is part of the ACT Accelerator – has developed a toolbox with guidance, tools, and training.
WHO’s Strategic Advisory Group of Experts (SAGE) has issued interim policy recommendations for the rollout of all of the COVID-19 vaccines approved for emergency use. These recommendations can guide and support country decision-making bodies, such as the National Immunization Technical Advisory Groups, on the optimal use of existing COVID-19 vaccines.  
WHO has also developed detailed technical guidance and adaptable planning tools and templates to help countries plan for COVID-19 vaccines considering the many aspects of readiness that need to be put in place. These areas include planning and implementation, data and monitoring, supply and logistics, and acceptance and demand. To support initial preparations, a vaccine introduction readiness assessment tool (VIRAT) has been developed and disseminated. It provides countries with an integrated roadmap of milestones and a framework for self-monitoring progress in preparing for vaccine introduction. This will help ensure that COVID-19 vaccines reach those in need as soon as they are available.
WHO advises every country to develop a National Deployment and Vaccination Plan (NDVP) for COVID-19 vaccines.  Having one plan in each country that comprehensively describes all elements of the country’s approach to COVID-19 vaccine rollout will be crucial for a coordinated effort. Guidance on developing that plan is available from WHO, including all elements that a country needs to consider.","['ndvp', 'support', 'logist', 'help', 'virat', 'capac', 'plan', 'guid', 'prepar', 'guidanc', 'develop', 'introduct', 'partner', 'toolbox', 'readi', 'tool', 'advisori', 'rollout', 'polici', 'element', 'workstream', 'covid', 'technic', 'vaccin', 'templat', 'acceler', 'need', 'countri', 'train', 'mileston']"
376,376,How is the research and development process being accelerated without compromising safety?,"WHO and its partners are committed to accelerating the development of COVID-19 vaccines while maintaining the highest standards on safety.
Vaccines go through various phases of development and testing – there are usually three phases to clinical trials, with the last one designed to assess the ability of the product to protect against disease, which is called efficacy. All phases assess safety. The last phase, phase III, is usually conducted in a large number of people, often 10’s of thousands.  After that, the vaccine needs to go through a review by the national regulatory authority, who will decide if the vaccine is safe and effective enough to be put on the market, and a policy committee, who will decide how the vaccine should be used.      
In the past, vaccines have been developed through a series of consecutive steps that can take many years. Now, given the urgent need for COVID-19 vaccines, unprecedented financial investments and scientific collaborations are changing how vaccines are developed. This means that some of the steps in the research and development process have been happening in parallel, while still maintaining strict clinical and safety standards. For example, some clinical trials are evaluating multiple vaccines at the same time. It is the scale of the financial and political commitments to the development of a vaccine that has allowed this accelerated development to take place. However, this does not make the studies any less rigorous.
The more vaccines in development the more opportunities there are for success.
Any longer-term safety assessment will be conducted through continued follow up of the clinical trial participants, as well as through specific studies and general pharmacovigilance of those being vaccinated in the roll out.  This represents standard practice for all newly authorized vaccines.","['ass', 'clinic', 'author', 'last', 'unpreced', 'usual', 'develop', 'financi', 'pharmacovigil', 'strict', 'commit', 'consecut', 'newli', 'maintain', 'standard', 'parallel', 'thousand', 'phase', 'safeti', 'research', 'iii', 'polit', 'trial', 'go', 'vaccin', 'step', 'conduct', 'decid', 'acceler', 'process']"
377,377,What are human challenge studies? What is WHO’s view on these studies?,"In a regular vaccine study, one group of volunteers at risk for a disease is given an experimental vaccine, and another group is not; researchers monitor both groups over time and compare outcomes to see if the vaccine is safe and effective.
In a human challenge vaccine study, healthy volunteers are given an experimental vaccine, and then deliberately exposed to the organism causing the disease to see if the vaccine works. Some scientists believe that this approach could accelerate COVID-19 vaccine development, in part because it would require far fewer volunteers than a typical study.
However, there are important ethical considerations that must be addressed – particularly for a new disease like COVID-19, which we do not yet fully understand and are still learning how to treat; it may be difficult for the medical community and potential volunteers to properly estimate the potential risks of participating in a COVID-19 human challenge study.

378,378,Who should participate in clinical trials for COVID-19 vaccines?,"Small (phase I) safety studies of COVID-19 vaccines should enroll healthy adult volunteers. Larger (phase II and III) studies should include volunteers that reflect the populations for whom the vaccines are intended. This means enrolling people from diverse geographic areas, racial and ethnic backgrounds, genders, and ages, as well as those with underlying health conditions that put them at higher risk for COVID-19. Including these groups in clinical trials is the only way to make sure that a vaccine will be safe and effective for everyone who needs it.

379,379,How do I volunteer for a COVID-19 vaccine trial?,"Opportunities to volunteer for a COVID-19 vaccine trial vary from country to country.

380,380,What vaccines are there against COVID-19?,"There are several COVID-19 vaccines validated for use by WHO (given Emergency Use Listing). The first mass vaccination programme started in early December 2020 and the number of vaccination doses administered is updated on a daily basis on the COVID-19 dashboard.
The WHO Emergency Use Listing process determines whether a product can be recommended for use based on all the available data on safety and efficacy and on its suitability in low- and middle-income countries. Vaccines are assessed to ensure they meet acceptable standards of quality, safety and efficacy using clinical trial data, manufacturing and quality control processes. The assessment weighs the threat posed by the emergency as well as the benefit that would accrue from the use of the product against any potential risks.
In line with their national regulations and legislation, countries have the autonomy to issue emergency use authorizations for any health product.  Domestic emergency use authorizations are issued at the discretion of countries and not subject to WHO approval.
As of 12 January 2022, the following vaccines have obtained EUL:
The Pfizer/BioNTech Comirnaty vaccine, 31 December 2020.

381,381,What are the benefits of getting vaccinated?,"Getting vaccinated could save your life. COVID-19 vaccines provide strong protection against serious illness, hospitalization and death. There is also some evidence that being vaccinated will make it less likely that you will pass the virus on to others, which means your decision to get the vaccine also protects those around you.
Even after getting vaccinated, keep taking precautions to protect yourself, family, friends and anyone else you may come into contact with. COVID-19 vaccines are highly effective, but some people will still get ill from COVID-19 after vaccination. There is also still a chance that you could also pass the virus on to others who are not vaccinated. Stay at least 1 meter away from other people, wear a properly fitted mask over your nose and mouth when you can’t keep this distance, avoid poorly ventilated places and settings, clean your hands frequently, stay home if unwell and get tested, and stay informed about how much virus is circulating in the areas where you travel, live and work.

382,382,Who should get vaccinated against COVID-19?,"WHO recommends that while vaccine supply is limited, the people at highest risk of COVID-19 are vaccinated first. This includes people who are more likely to get severe disease if they are infected (older persons and people with existing health conditions) and people who are more likely to be exposed to the virus (such as health workers). People who are pregnant have a higher risk of serious illness and preterm birth if they are infected with COVID-19, so WHO recommends that they are also prioritized for vaccination, once the first priority groups have been vaccinated.
If you live in a country where vaccines are available to more people beyond these priority groups, get vaccinated as soon as it is your turn.
WHO-authorized COVID-19 vaccines are safe for most people of 18 years and older, including those with pre-existing conditions of any kind such as auto-immune disorders. These conditions include hypertension, diabetes, asthma, pulmonary, liver and kidney disease, as well as chronic infections that are stable and controlled.
The Pfizer vaccine can be safely administered to children from 5 years of age. Both Moderna and Pfizer vaccines are licensed for use in children from 12 years of age. 
Vaccine trials for the use of other COVID-19 vaccines in children and adolescents are ongoing and WHO will update its recommendations when the evidence or epidemiological situation justifies a change in policy.
Children and adolescents above 5 years of age with comorbidities that put them at significantly higher risk of serious COVID-19 may be offered vaccination alongside other high priority groups.
However, WHO recommends that countries should vaccinate healthy children only when high vaccine coverage with two doses has been achieved in higher priority-use groups, as identified in the WHO Prioritization Roadmap.
There are very few conditions that would exclude someone from being vaccinated, but you should NOT be vaccinated if:
You have a history of severe allergic reactions/anaphylaxis to any of the ingredients of the COVID-19 vaccine, in order to avoid possible adverse effects.
You have a fever over 38.5ºC on the day of your vaccine appointment. Postpone until you have recovered.
You currently have confirmed or suspected COVID-19. Wait until you have completed the mandated isolation period and your acute symptoms have passed to get vaccinated.
COVID-19 vaccines are safe for people taking blood thinners, but you should let the person giving you the vaccine know about any medication you are taking BEFORE you are given the vaccine.
In addition to the general recommendations above, each vaccine may have specific considerations for specific populations and health conditions. Talk to your doctor for advice about your specific situation.

383,383,Should I be vaccinated if I have had COVID-19?,"Yes. Even if you have already had COVID-19, you should be vaccinated. The protection that someone gains from having COVID-19 will vary greatly from person to person. The immunity people get from being vaccinated after having a natural infection is consistently very strong. Getting vaccinated even if you have had COVID-19 means you are more likely to be protected for longer.
There is currently no evidence to determine the optimal time that you should wait to be vaccinated after having COVID-19. Persons with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 infection can consider delaying vaccination for 6 months based on the fact that natural infection leads to some protection against infection. Ask your health worker for advice.","['month', 'even', 'determin', 'gain', 'laboratori', 'longer', 'delay', 'protect', 'greatli', 'vari', 'person', 'mean', 'optim', 'get', 'advic', 'alreadi', 'strong', 'confirm', 'covid', 'ye', 'vaccin', 'consist', 'worker', 'lead', 'wait', 'infect', 'natur', 'fact', 'someon', 'ask']"

385,385,Which COVID-19 vaccine should I get?,"All vaccines with WHO Emergency Use Listing are highly effective at preventing serious illness, hospitalization and death due to COVID-19. You should accept the vaccine you are offered first and get vaccinated as soon as it is your turn to reduce your risk.
Do not delay getting vaccinated, unless advised to by your healthcare provider, as this could put you at risk of COVID-19. Getting vaccinated could save your life.
In April 2020, WHO published the minimum criteria for how effective COVID-19 vaccines should be to make them useful for fighting COVID-19. All current vaccines authorized by WHO meet these criteria. To fully understand how effective different vaccines are, we need more real world data. This will come as more people are vaccinated.

386,386,How quickly could COVID-19 vaccines stop the pandemic?,"COVID-19 vaccines are an important tool to stop the pandemic, but they will not do so on their own. Public health and social measures such as surveillance, contact tracing, isolation and individual protective behaviors such as staying at least 1 meter away from other people, wearing a properly fitted mask over your nose and mouth, avoiding poorly ventilated places and settings, staying home if unwell, covering coughs and sneezes and cleaning your hands frequently remain essential to breaking the chain of transmission.
The impact of COVID-19 vaccines on the pandemic will depend on several factors. These include the effectiveness of the vaccines; how quickly they are approved, manufactured, and delivered; the possible development of other variants, and how many people get vaccinated.","['poorli', 'essenti', 'fit', 'trace', 'pandem', 'remain', 'unwel', 'manufactur', 'nose', 'deliv', 'peopl', 'chain', 'factor', 'tool', 'stay', 'isol', 'sneez', 'quickli', 'depend', 'covid', 'cover', 'properli', 'mouth', 'behavior', 'vaccin', 'away', 'break', 'approv', 'surveil', 'stop']"
387,387,What is the difference between the immunity you develop from getting COVID-19 and immunity from getting a COVID-19 vaccine?,"We are still learning about how long immunity to COVID-19 lasts from natural infection, and from vaccination. We are now starting to see evidence that the immunity you get after having COVID-19 can be strong. However, the type of immunity that's developed after infection varies from person to person, making it less predictable than immunity after vaccination. Scientists are working hard to understand this better.
What we do know is that COVID-19 is a life-threatening disease that can have long-term consequences. We also know that the WHO-authorized COVID-19 vaccines have been safely given to billions of people. It is much safer to get vaccinated than it is to risk getting COVID-19. Get vaccinated as soon as it’s your turn and keep doing everything you can to protect yourself and others.
As we learn more about COVID-19 and immunity, WHO continues to update our guidance and recommendations.","['consequ', 'see', 'last', 'soon', 'immun', 'guidanc', 'develop', 'threaten', 'turn', 'updat', 'learn', 'vari', 'safer', 'predict', 'life', 'person', 'hard', 'get', 'everyth', 'strong', 'term', 'covid', 'know', 'scientist', 'vaccin', 'start', 'long', 'infect', 'natur', 'billion']"
388,388,Do the COVID-19 vaccines protect against virus variants?,"The COVID-19 vaccines with WHO Emergency Use Listing (EUL) provide different levels of protection to infection, mild disease, severe disease, hospitalization and death. Research is ongoing by thousands of scientists around the world to better understand how new virus mutations and variants affect the effectiveness of the different COVID-19 vaccines.
In general, the COVID-19 vaccines are very effective at preventing serious illness, hospitalization and death from all current virus variants. They are less effective at protecting you against infection and mild disease than they were for earlier virus variants; but if you do get ill after being vaccinated, your symptoms are more likely to be mild.
Remember that while the COVID-19 vaccines authorized by WHO are incredibly effective at reducing your risk of developing serious illness and death, no vaccine is 100% effective. A small percentage of people will still get ill from COVID-19 even though they have been vaccinated. Currently there is limited information about the risk of vaccinated people passing the virus to others if they are infected. This makes it very important to continue to practice public health and social measures, even after you have been fully vaccinated.","['diseas', 'even', 'variant', 'small', 'list', 'ill', 'rememb', 'current', 'protect', 'risk', 'though', 'peopl', 'hospit', 'death', 'thousand', 'seriou', 'get', 'ongo', 'covid', 'incred', 'eul', 'earlier', 'differ', 'viru', 'effect', 'vaccin', 'percentag', 'infect', 'mild', 'pas']"
389,389,What types of COVID-19 vaccines are there? How do they work?,"Scientists around the world are continuing to develop many potential vaccines for COVID-19. These vaccines are all designed to teach the body’s immune system to safely recognize and block the virus that causes COVID-19.
Several different types of potential vaccines for COVID-19 have been developed, including:
Inactivated or weakened virus vaccines, which use a form of the virus that has been inactivated or weakened so it doesn’t cause disease but still generates an immune response.
Protein-based vaccines, which use harmless fragments of proteins or protein shells that mimic the COVID-19 virus to safely generate an immune response.
Viral vector vaccines, which use a safe virus that cannot cause disease but serves as a platform to produce coronavirus proteins to generate an immune response.
RNA and DNA vaccines, a cutting-edge approach that uses genetically engineered RNA or DNA to generate a protein that itself safely prompts an immune response.","['inactiv', 'potenti', 'vector', 'immun', 'caus', 'edg', 'type', 'develop', 'platform', 'dna', 'fragment', 'block', 'protein', 'cut', 'covid', 'prompt', 'safe', 'use', 'shell', 'serv', 'viru', 'vaccin', 'gener', 'teach', 'weaken', 'harmless', 'engin', 'mimic', 'rna', 'respons']"
390,390,Can I have the second or third dose with a different vaccine than the first dose?,"It is safe and effective for you to receive a second or a third dose of a different COVID-19 vaccine. If you’re offered a different type of vaccine, you can go ahead and get vaccinated. WHO considers two doses of any WHO EUL vaccine to be a complete primary series.
By mixing and matching vaccines, countries are able to maximize vaccine impact in the event of constrained or limited supply. 
People over 60 who have received two doses of Sinovac and Sinopharm should be given a third dose to restore waning immunity over time. WHO Strategic Advisory Group of Experts on Immunization (SAGE) has stated that Pfizer or AstraZeneca can also be used for the third dose, if the original vaccine is not available.","['seri', 'two', 'wane', 'second', 'immun', 'origin', 'maxim', 'astrazeneca', 'match', 'sinovac', 'sage', 'constrain', 'advisori', 'pfizer', 'offer', 'mix', 'suppli', 'complet', 'restor', 'eul', 'receiv', 'strateg', 'dose', 'event', 'differ', 'ahead', 'vaccin', 'sinopharm', 'third', 'primari']"
391,391,What are the side effects of COVID-19 vaccines?,"Like with any vaccine, some people will experience mild to moderate side effects after being vaccinated against COVID-19. This is a normal sign that the body is developing protection. Side effects to COVID-19 vaccines include a fever, tiredness, headache, muscle ache, chills, diarrhea and pain or redness at the injection site. Not everyone will experience side effects. Most side effects go away within a few days on their own. You can manage any side effects with rest, plenty of non-alcoholic liquids and taking medication to manage pain and fever, if needed.
If you are worried that the side effects that you are experiencing are unusual, if the pain in the arm where you got the injection gets worse after 24 hours or your side effects don’t go away in a few days, contact your healthcare provider for advice.
More serious or long-lasting side effects to COVID-19 vaccines are possible but extremely rare. If you experience difficulty breathing, chest pain, confusion, loss of speech or mobility after your vaccine, contact your healthcare provider immediately.","['wors', 'plenti', 'confus', 'red', 'chill', 'ach', 'healthcar', 'got', 'tired', 'pain', 'extrem', 'day', 'arm', 'side', 'manag', 'rest', 'unusu', 'covid', 'go', 'inject', 'contact', 'liquid', 'diarrhea', 'effect', 'experi', 'vaccin', 'away', 'speech', 'provid', 'fever']"
392,392,Does having side effects mean that the vaccine is working? What does having no side effects mean?,"The vaccine stimulates your immune system to protect you from the virus. This process can sometimes cause side effects like fever, chills or headache, but not everyone will experience any side effects. The presence or magnitude of the reaction you may have vaccination does not predict or reflect your immune response to the vaccine.
You do not have to have side effects in order to be protected.","['work', 'aadhaar', 'magnitud', 'order', 'immun', 'like', 'chill', 'caus', 'reflect', 'protect', 'stimul', 'may', 'abattoir', 'aarogya', 'predict', 'mean', 'headach', 'side', 'sometim', 'viru', 'effect', 'vaccin', 'reaction', 'everyon', 'experi', 'system', 'process', 'fever', 'respons', 'presenc']"

394,394,Is there a link between COVID-19 vaccines and allergic reactions?,"In very rare cases, some people may experience an allergic reaction after being vaccinated against COVID-19. A severe allergic reaction – such as anaphylaxis – is a very rare side effect of any vaccine.
If you have a history of allergic reactions, talk to your healthcare provider before you get vaccinated. They will be able to give you advice. In some cases, precautions will need to be taken for people who have known allergies to previous doses of the vaccine or known components of the vaccine.
Healthcare workers administering COVID-19 vaccines should be trained to recognise and treat serious allergic reactions. This is why people being vaccinated against COVID-19 will be asked to stay at the vaccination site for a period of time following their injection, to ensure that anyone experiencing an allergic reaction can receive prompt treatment.
Reports of adverse events following COVID-19 vaccination (including allergic reactions) are closely monitored by national authorities and international bodies, including WHO for the early detection of serious side effects.

395,395,What happens if a serious adverse event is reported after vaccination?,"As with any vaccine, it is essential to closely monitor the safety and effectiveness of COVID-19 vaccines that are used in immunization programmes. If a serious health problem is reported following vaccination, a thorough investigation should take place by the public health programme in the country.
It is rare to find that health problems occurring following receipt of a vaccine are actually caused by the vaccine itself. Health problems following vaccination are most often found to be coincidental and entirely unrelated to vaccination. Sometimes they are related to how the vaccine has been stored, transported, or administered. Errors related to the delivery of the vaccine can be prevented by better training health workers and strengthening supply chains.
The results of the investigation will then inform next steps. The safety of COVID-19 vaccines is the top priority of the World Health Organization.","['transport', 'coincident', 'chain', 'strengthen', 'relat', 'problem', 'advers', 'unrel', 'seriou', 'actual', 'safeti', 'deliveri', 'health', 'report', 'sometim', 'thorough', 'investig', 'rare', 'prioriti', 'error', 'next', 'vaccin', 'step', 'receipt', 'store', 'programm', 'entir', 'top', 'train', 'follow']"
396,396,Can I still get COVID-19 after I have been vaccinated?,"Yes. The maximum level of protection from COVID-19 vaccines is not reached until several weeks after full vaccination. If you have a two-dose vaccine, this means that you don’t get full immunity until 2 – 4 weeks after the second dose. You can still become infected and ill during this time.
While COVID-19 vaccines are highly effective against serious illness, hospitalization and death, no vaccine is 100% effective. As a result, a number of vaccinated people will get infected and may fall ill with COVID-19 in spite of being fully vaccinated. This is known as a ‘breakthrough infection’ or ‘breakthrough case’. With more infectious virus variants such as Delta, we are seeing more breakthrough infections and cases.
Breakthrough infections can happen with every vaccine, and do not mean that the vaccine does not work. According to data from the US CDC, unvaccinated people are at 11 times the risk of death from COVID-19 than vaccinated people. People who get COVID-19 after being vaccinated are much more likely to only experience mild symptoms; efficacy against serious illness and death remains high. Get vaccinated, as soon as it’s your turn.
Even once you are fully vaccinated, continue to practice the same prevention measures to protect yourself. Stay at least 1 meter away from other people, wear a well fitted mask over your nose and mouth when you can’t keep this distance, avoid poorly ventilated places and settings, clean your hands frequently, stay home if unwell and get tested and stay informed about how much virus is circulating in the areas where you travel, live and work.","['breakthrough', 'poorli', 'much', 'work', 'ill', 'case', 'still', 'peopl', 'protect', 'fulli', 'death', 'week', 'stay', 'mean', 'fall', 'seriou', 'efficaci', 'get', 'full', 'spite', 'time', 'covid', 'unvaccin', 'dose', 'reach', 'effect', 'vaccin', 'viru', 'infect', 'maximum']"
397,397,Does being vaccinated stop me from infecting other people with COVID-19?,"There is some evidence that being fully vaccinated can prevent infection with the COVID-19 virus. This means that being vaccinated is likely to help protect people around you by making it less likely that you will pick up the virus and pass it on.
Research is ongoing to understand the extent to which being vaccinated stops you from becoming infected and passing the virus on to others. More data is needed to know the extent of this protection. There is still a chance you could pass the virus on.  
Even once you are fully vaccinated, continue to practice the same prevention measures to protect other people. Stay at least 1 meter away from other people, wear a properly fitted mask over your nose and mouth when you can’t keep this distance, avoid poorly ventilated places and settings, clean your hands frequently, stay home if unwell and get tested, and stay informed about how much virus is circulating in the areas where you travel, live and work.

398,398,Can I stop taking precautions after being vaccinated?,"No. Even after getting vaccinated, keep taking precautions to protect yourself, family and friends if there is still COVID-19 in your area.
The maximum level of protection is not reached until several weeks after full vaccination. If you have a two-dose vaccine, this means that you don’t get full immunity until 2–4 weeks after the second dose.
COVID-19 vaccines are highly effective, but a small percentage of people will still get ill from COVID-19 after vaccination (this is known as a breakthrough infection). There is also still a chance that you could pass the virus on to others who are not vaccinated. Some people have not been vaccinated against COVID-19, cannot be vaccinated, or do not develop full immunity in response to COVID-19 vaccines because of having a weakened immune system. Continue to practice all protective behaviors to protect yourself and others.
Even once you are fully vaccinated, stay at least 1 meter away from other people, wear a properly fitted mask over your nose and mouth when you can’t keep this distance, avoid poorly ventilated places and settings, clean your hands frequently, stay home if unwell and get tested, stay informed about how much virus is circulating in the areas where you travel, live and work, and get vaccinated as soon as it is your turn.

399,399,How long does protection from COVID-19 vaccines last?,"We still don’t know exactly how long protection from COVID-19 vaccines lasts, but current data indicates that most people have strong protection against serious illness and death for at least 6 months.
There is increasing evidence that the effectiveness of COVID-19 vaccine against infection and mild symptoms can wane over time. In light of this, WHO Strategic Advisory Group of Experts on Immunization (SAGE) has advised that booster doses are offered to people 4-6 months after the primary series of vaccination is completed. A booster dose should be taken when offered, to strengthen protection against serious illness and death from COVID-19.
Immunity may reduce faster in people who are older or who have underlying medical conditions, or who have a high level of exposure to the virus, so SAGE recommends that boosters are offered to higher priority-use groups before vaccines are given to those in lower-priority use groups.
People over 60 and immune-compromised who have received two doses of Sinovac and Sinopharm should also be given an additional third dose as part of the primary series to reach sufficient immunity. A booster dose is recommended for these vaccines, for more details consult the interim recommendations.
To protect yourself, get vaccinated AND continue practicing the recommended protective behaviors against COVID-19, including regular hand-washing, physical distancing, and ventilation of rooms.","['month', 'group', 'seri', 'last', 'wane', 'light', 'immun', 'exactli', 'ill', 'protect', 'peopl', 'sinovac', 'death', 'sage', 'given', 'offer', 'seriou', 'interim', 'faster', 'covid', 'prioriti', 'strateg', 'dose', 'vaccin', 'sinopharm', 'long', 'recommend', 'third', 'primari', 'booster']"
400,400,Who needs an additional dose of COVID-19 vaccines?,"People with compromised immune systems don’t always develop maximum immunity against COVID-19 after one or two doses, so may need an additional dose to protect them. WHO recommends that people who are moderately or severely immunocompromised should be offered an additional dose of COVID-19 vaccine.
For Sinovac and Sinopharm, WHO recommends that countries should consider offering a third dose of the vaccine to the vaccination schedule for those aged 60 and over as an extension of the primary series, once a high level of coverage of first and second doses has been achieved in the priority groups.
An additional dose is different from a booster dose. It is considered part of an extended primary series for people who do not develop sufficient protection after one or two doses. It is intended to help these individuals to develop better protection against COVID-19.

401,401,How many booster doses of COVID-19 vaccine do I need?,"A booster dose is an extra dose of vaccine administered to a vaccinated person that has completed a primary vaccination series, (currently one, two or three doses of COVID-19 vaccine depending on the vaccine and the population group) when, with time, the immunity and clinical protection has fallen below a rate deemed sufficient in that population.
The protection you get from COVID-19 vaccines can wane over time, evidence shows that the effectiveness wanes around 4-6 months after the primary series of vaccination has been completed. If you are offered a booster you should take it to strengthen your protection against serious disease.  
WHO currently recommends that individuals over the age of 18 have 1 booster dose 4-6 months after completing the primary series. WHO does not currently recommend that children and young adults under the age of 18 receive a booster dose.
SAGE recommends that high-priority use groups are offered boosters, prior to continuing the roll-out of primary vaccination among lower-priority use groups.
SAGE is reviewing the available data on the need for additional booster doses to maintain protection against COVID-19 and will update the recommendations accordingly.

402,402,"Can the COVID-19 vaccine cause a positive test result for the disease, such as for a PCR or antigen test?","No, the COVID-19 vaccine will not cause a positive test result for a COVID-19 PCR or antigen laboratory test. This is because the tests check for active disease and not whether an individual is immune. However, because the COVID-19 vaccine prompts an immune response, it may be possible to test positive in an antibody (serology) test that measures COVID-19 immunity in an individual.","['diseas', 'aadhaar', 'whether', 'immun', 'laboratori', 'possibl', 'caus', 'test', 'may', 'result', 'activ', 'aarogya', 'abattoir', 'abhishek', 'abid', 'pcr', 'howev', 'posit', 'antigen', 'check', 'covid', 'abdomin', 'abil', 'individu', 'vaccin', 'antibodi', 'serolog', 'measur', 'prompt', 'respons']"
403,403,"Once I have been vaccinated, can I safely travel internationally?","You should follow national advice and the advice of the countries you are traveling to and from.  Some countries are allowing fully vaccinated people to avoid quarantine and testing on arrival. This is because these individuals are at a lower risk of COVID-19 and are less likely to get infected and pass the virus to others. But even once you are fully vaccinated, continue to practice the same prevention measures – no vaccine is 100% effective, and doing it all helps protect yourself and others. Stay at least 1 meter away from other people, wear a properly fitted mask over your nose and mouth when you can’t keep this distance, avoid poorly ventilated places and settings, clean your hands frequently, stay home if unwell and get tested, and stay informed about how much virus is circulating in the areas where you travel, live and work.
WHO does not support using proof of vaccination as a requirement for international travel. This would not be fair, given that there are not enough vaccines for everyone, and that some countries have more access to vaccines than others.

404,404,Is it safe for me to take antibiotics after the vaccine?,"There is no known influence or interaction between antibiotics and COVID-19 vaccines. If you are prescribed antibiotics by a health professional before or after your vaccination, you should go ahead and take the full course. However, if you have a temperature over 38.5 ºC at the time of your vaccination appointment, you should reschedule for when you feel better.","['aadhaar', 'temperatur', 'prescrib', 'appoint', 'profession', 'take', 'known', 'aarogya', 'abattoir', 'abhishek', 'cours', 'feel', 'abid', 'howev', 'full', 'time', 'health', 'better', 'go', 'covid', 'abdomin', 'safe', 'abil', 'reschedul', 'abl', 'ahead', 'vaccin', 'antibiot', 'interact', 'influenc']"
405,405,Is it safe to drink alcohol after getting a COVID-19 vaccine?,"There is no evidence that the safety or effectiveness of COVID-19 vaccines is affected by anything you eat or drink before or after getting vaccinated, including alcohol. However, drinking alcohol can add to the normal mild to moderate side effects that you might experience after vaccination, such as a headache and tiredness. Because of this, it is advisable to avoid drinking until any side effects following vaccination have passed.
While COVID-19 vaccines are highly effective at preventing serious illness and death, there is still a chance you could be infected after being vaccinated. Continue to protect yourself and others by continuing to practice physical distancing, wear a well-fitted mask over your nose and mouth, clean your hands frequently, stay home if you feel unwell, cover coughs and sneezes and keep indoor spaces well ventilated. Drinking alcohol may make you less vigilant in practicing these behaviors and so can put you and others at risk.

406,406,Can children and adolescents get vaccinated against COVID-19?,"The Pfizer vaccine can be safely administered to children from 5 years of age. Both Moderna and Pfizer vaccines are licensed for use in children from 12 years of age. 
WHO recommends that children aged 5 and above with comorbidities that put them at significant risk of severe COVID-19 should be offered vaccination, at a reduced dosage, alongside other high-risk groups.
Countries may now consider vaccinating healthy children from the age of 5 years of age and adolescents as part of their national vaccination strategies. However, WHO strongly recommends that countries should vaccinate children only when high vaccine coverage with primary vaccination series has been achieved in higher priority-use groups, as identified in the WHO Prioritization Roadmap.
Vaccine trials for children and adolescents and other COVID-19 vaccines are ongoing and WHO will update its recommendations when the evidence or epidemiological situation justifies a change in policy.
COVID-19 has also been a more serious and dangerous disease among older people. While the supply of vaccines is constrained, the ongoing priority is to vaccinate those most at risk of serious illness who still have not been vaccinated in many parts of the world: older people, those with chronic health conditions and health workers.
Most children are at low risk of serious disease and vaccinating them would be primarily about reducing transmission. There is emerging evidence that vaccines may be less effective at reducing transmission of Omicron. This means that the most impactful thing that can be done to protect children while vaccines are still being prioritized for those most at risk is to continue to practice the protective behaviors: keep a safe distance from others and avoid crowds, wear a well-fitting mask covering your mouth and nose, keep indoor spaces well ventilated, clean hands regularly and cover coughs and sneezes. Caregivers should follow national guidelines around children staying home from school if unwell, getting tested for COVID-19 when showing symptoms.","['year', 'group', 'reduc', 'older', 'still', 'risk', 'evid', 'child', 'constrain', 'pfizer', 'age', 'seriou', 'licens', 'adolesc', 'ongo', 'alongsid', 'covid', 'prioriti', 'part', 'cover', 'keep', 'safe', 'dosag', 'vaccin', 'nation', 'strongli', 'high', 'recommend', 'priorit', 'well']"
407,407,Can I get vaccinated against COVID-19 if I am pregnant?,"Yes, you can get vaccinated if you are pregnant. During pregnancy, you are at higher risk of serious illness caused by COVID-19. You are also at higher risk of delivering your baby prematurely if you contract COVID-19. While there is less data available on vaccination of pregnant people, evidence on the safety of COVID-19 vaccines during pregnancy has been growing, and no safety concerns have been identified. Especially in countries with high transmission, or if you have an occupation where you are at more risk of being exposed to COVID-19, the benefits of getting the vaccine outweigh potential risks. There is no risk of getting COVID-19 from the vaccine.

412,412,How do we know that COVID-19 vaccines are safe?,"There are strict precautions in place to help ensure the safety of all COVID-19 vaccines. Before receiving validation from WHO and national regulatory agencies for emergency use, COVID-19 vaccines must undergo rigorous testing in clinical trials to prove that they meet internationally agreed benchmarks for safety and efficacy.
Unprecedented scientific collaborations have allowed COVID-19 vaccine research, development, and authorizations to be completed in record time – to meet the urgent need for these vaccines while maintaining high safety standards. As with all vaccines, WHO and regulatory authorities will continuously monitor the use of COVID-19 vaccines to identify and respond to any safety issues that might arise. Through that process, we ascertain that they remain safe for use around the world.","['aris', 'author', 'agre', 'regulatori', 'collabor', 'unpreced', 'scientif', 'might', 'benchmark', 'strict', 'allow', 'valid', 'issu', 'urgent', 'standard', 'ascertain', 'efficaci', 'record', 'safeti', 'respond', 'complet', 'meet', 'rigor', 'covid', 'use', 'safe', 'vaccin', 'prove', 'undergo', 'agenc']"
413,413,How does WHO ensure that COVID-19 vaccines are safe and effective?,"The vaccines must be proven safe and effective in large Phase III clinical trials. Some COVID-19 vaccine candidates have already completed their Phase III trials and are being used globally, and many other vaccine candidates are being developed and are still in the trial phase.
Independent reviews of the efficacy and safety evidence are required by WHO for each vaccine candidate, including regulatory review and approval in the country where the vaccine is manufactured, before WHO considers it for emergency use listing.
An external panel of experts convened by WHO (the Strategic Advisory Group of Experts on Immunization (SAGE), analyses the results from clinical trials, along with evidence on the disease, age groups affected, risk factors for disease, programmatic use and other information. SAGE then recommends whether and how the vaccines should be used. In addition to reviewing data for regulatory purposes, the evidence must also be reviewed for the purpose of policy recommendations on how the vaccines should be used.
The WHO’s Global Advisory Committee on Vaccine Safety (GACVS) monitors how approved vaccines behave in the real world and to identify any signals of adverse events following immunization. GACVS is an independent group of experts providing authoritative, scientific advice to WHO on vaccine safety issues of global or regional concern.","['authorit', 'group', 'clinic', 'panel', 'regulatori', 'global', 'purpos', 'immun', 'evid', 'committe', 'sage', 'candid', 'advisori', 'phase', 'review', 'iii', 'safeti', 'programmat', 'trial', 'independ', 'expert', 'conven', 'use', 'safe', 'vaccin', 'gacv', 'must', 'approv', 'behav', 'extern']"
414,414,What systems are in place to monitor vaccine safety?,"Vaccine safety monitoring is critical at national, regional, and global levels. After any vaccine is introduced, WHO works with vaccine manufacturers, health officials, national advisory committees and other partners to monitor for any safety concerns on an ongoing basis. Specific safety concerns that arise are then evaluated by WHO and an independent group of experts (the Global Advisory Committee on Vaccine Safety, or GACVS) in conjunction with the relevant national authorities.
As is standard practice in all national immunization programmes, WHO is supporting the implementation of safety monitoring systems for COVID-19 vaccines in every country.","['everi', 'specif', 'aris', 'offici', 'global', 'manufactur', 'region', 'partner', 'monitor', 'critic', 'evalu', 'introduc', 'committe', 'advisori', 'standard', 'implement', 'safeti', 'concern', 'independ', 'ongo', 'expert', 'practic', 'vaccin', 'nation', 'gacv', 'system', 'relev', 'conjunct', 'programm', 'basi']"
415,415,How will WHO inform the public about suspected or confirmed serious adverse events related to COVID-19 vaccines?,"Suspected safety events officially reported to WHO go through a series of rapid verification steps involving the Global Advisory Committee on Vaccine Safety (GACVS). WHO then shares the results of these evaluations on its website and publishes the results of any assessments.
WHO also coordinates with local, regional, and national health officials to investigate vaccine safety concerns and advise on next steps.
Additional vaccine safety information is also made available through the Vaccine Safety Net, a global network of websites providing reliable information on vaccine safety that have been verified by WHO.","['involv', 'net', 'seri', 'offici', 'global', 'publish', 'reliabl', 'verif', 'inform', 'region', 'evalu', 'result', 'committe', 'advis', 'advisori', 'advers', 'also', 'safeti', 'rapid', 'coordin', 'verifi', 'investig', 'websit', 'event', 'next', 'suspect', 'vaccin', 'step', 'gacv', 'network']"
416,416,Under what circumstances should a COVID-19 vaccine be recalled?,"In rare situations where a serious adverse reaction is suspected to be related to the vaccine itself, the vaccine may be temporarily suspended from use while the situation is assessed. Investigations will take place to determine what exactly caused the event, and corrective measures will be put in place. WHO works closely with vaccine manufacturers, health officials, researchers, and other partners to monitor any safety concerns and potential side effects.
Vaccine recalls or withdrawals due to safety issues are rare. Recalls are generally associated with problems identified during the monitoring of batches of vaccines through quality control systems, stability studies and reports from the field, including cold chain issues where some vaccines have not been stored at the right conditions and so are no longer safe or effective. In this case, people who have received a vaccine from that batch may need to be vaccinated again to ensure they are protected. This is why vaccines are so closely monitored – to ensure that any issues with their production, storage or use can be rapidly identified and resolved.","['withdraw', 'place', 'exactli', 'close', 'cold', 'recal', 'monitor', 'chain', 'situat', 'qualiti', 'issu', 'circumst', 'ensur', 'advers', 'correct', 'safeti', 'resolv', 'field', 'identifi', 'rare', 'suspend', 'effect', 'vaccin', 'reaction', 'stabil', 'store', 'rapidli', 'temporarili', 'batch', 'storag']"
417,417,What are the side effects of COVID-19 vaccines?,"Like with any vaccine, some people will experience mild to moderate side effects after being vaccinated against COVID-19. This is a normal sign that the body is developing protection. Side effects to COVID-19 vaccines include a fever, tiredness, headache, muscle ache, chills, diarrhea and pain or redness at the injection site. Not everyone will experience side effects. Most side effects go away within a few days on their own. You can manage any side effects with rest, plenty of non-alcoholic liquids and taking medication to manage pain and fever, if needed.
If you are worried that the side effects that you are experiencing are unusual, if the pain in the arm where you got the injection gets worse after 24 hours or your side effects don’t go away in a few days, contact your healthcare provider for advice.
More serious or long-lasting side effects to COVID-19 vaccines are possible but extremely rare. If you experience difficulty breathing, chest pain, confusion, loss of speech or mobility after your vaccine, contact your healthcare provider immediately. Vaccines are continually monitored for as long as they are in use to detect and respond to rare adverse events.","['wors', 'plenti', 'red', 'chill', 'ach', 'healthcar', 'got', 'tired', 'pain', 'day', 'arm', 'side', 'manag', 'rest', 'go', 'rare', 'covid', 'inject', 'unusu', 'contact', 'liquid', 'diarrhea', 'effect', 'experi', 'vaccin', 'away', 'speech', 'long', 'provid', 'fever']"
418,418,Does having side effects mean that the vaccine is working? What does having no side effects mean?,"The vaccine stimulates your immune system to protect you from the virus. This process can sometimes cause side effects like fever, chills or headache, but not everyone will experience any side effects. The presence or magnitude of the reaction you may have vaccination does not predict or reflect your immune response to the vaccine.

420,420,Is there a link between COVID-19 vaccines and allergic reactions?,"In very rare cases, some people may experience an allergic reaction after being vaccinated against COVID-19. A severe allergic reaction – such as anaphylaxis – is a very rare side effect of any vaccine.
If you have a history of allergic reactions, talk to your healthcare provider before you get vaccinated. They will be able to give you advice. In some cases, precautions will need to be taken for people who have known allergies to previous doses of the vaccine or known components of the vaccine.
Healthcare workers administering COVID-19 vaccines should be trained to recognise and treat serious allergic reactions. This is why people being vaccinated against COVID-19 will be asked to stay at the vaccination site for a period of time following their injection, to ensure that anyone experiencing an allergic reaction can receive prompt treatment.
Reports of adverse events following COVID-19 vaccination (including allergic reactions) are closely monitored by national authorities and international bodies, including WHO for the early detection of serious side effects.

421,421,What happens if a serious adverse event is reported after vaccination?,"As with any vaccine, it is essential to closely monitor the safety and effectiveness of COVID-19 vaccines that are used in immunization programmes. If a serious health problem is reported following vaccination, a thorough investigation should take place by the public health programme in the country.
It is rare to find that health problems occurring following receipt of a vaccine are actually caused by the vaccine itself. Health problems following vaccination are most often found to be coincidental and entirely unrelated to vaccination. Sometimes they are related to how the vaccine has been stored, transported, or administered. Errors related to the delivery of the vaccine can be prevented by better training health workers and strengthening supply chains.
The results of the investigation will then inform next steps. The safety of COVID-19 vaccines is the top priority of the World Health Organization.","['transport', 'coincident', 'chain', 'strengthen', 'relat', 'problem', 'advers', 'unrel', 'seriou', 'actual', 'safeti', 'deliveri', 'health', 'report', 'sometim', 'thorough', 'investig', 'rare', 'prioriti', 'error', 'next', 'vaccin', 'step', 'receipt', 'store', 'programm', 'entir', 'top', 'train', 'follow']"
422,422,Is it safe to mix-and-match different COVID-19 vaccines?,"It is safe for you to receive two different COVID-19 vaccines for your first and second dose. This is sometimes called mixing and matching vaccines, or a heterologous vaccine schedule. WHO considers two doses of any WHO EUL COVID-19 vaccines to be a complete primary series.
By mixing and matching vaccines, countries are able to maximize vaccine impact in the event of constrained or limited supply. 
People over 60 who have received two doses of Sinovac and Sinopharm can also be given a third dose to help boost their immunity, once a high level of coverage of the priority groups has been achieved. SAGE has stated that Pfizer or AstraZeneca can be used for the third dose if the original vaccine is not available.
Further trials are underway to understand more about mixed doses, which will inform any future changes to WHO’s recommendations.

425,425,Is there a risk of heart inflammation (myocarditis or pericarditis) from mRNA COVID-19 vaccines?,"Globally, mRNA vaccines such as Pfizer and Moderna have been used to protect millions of people against COVID-19. A significant amount of data is available from both clinical trials and country surveillance programmes on their efficacy and safety. Some mild side effects are expected after vaccination; these are a normal sign that the body is developing protection.
There have been reports of very rare cases of myocarditis (inflammation of the heart muscle) and pericarditis (inflammation of the membrane surrounding the heart) following the second dose of mRNA COVID-19 vaccines. Myocarditis and pericarditis can be caused by many factors, including infections, viruses, medicines and environmental factors. The currently available data suggests that there is also a potential relationship between these symptoms and mRNA vaccines. Research is underway to understand more.
Cases have been mostly reported in younger men aged 12 – 29 (40.6 cases of myocarditis per million second doses) compared to females of the same age group (4.2 cases per million second doses).
The symptoms of myocarditis and pericarditis are generally mild. Fast treatment with medication and rest can help to avoid long term heart damage and death. If you experience new and persisting chest pain, shortness of breath or have a racing or pounding heartbeat within a few days of vaccination, contact your doctor immediately. The benefits of these vaccines greatly outweigh the risk of myocarditis and pericarditis by preventing deaths and hospitalisations due to COVID-19.","['second', 'case', 'avail', 'hospitalis', 'greatli', 'factor', 'death', 'million', 'age', 'fast', 'report', 'inflamm', 'men', 'mostli', 'covid', 'heart', 'surround', 'heartbeat', 'dose', 'data', 'pound', 'vaccin', 'mrna', 'race', 'pericard', 'femal', 'per', 'mild', 'myocard', 'membran']"
426,426,Do the COVID-19 AstraZeneca and Johnson & Johnson/Janssen vaccines cause blood clots?,"Globally, COVID-19 vaccines such as AstraZeneca and Johnson &Johnson/Janssen have been used to protect millions of people. Data is available from both clinical trials and preliminary data from country surveillance programmes on their efficacy and safety. Some mild to moderate side effects such as fever, muscle and headaches, soreness around the injection site and tiredness are expected to affect some people after vaccination. These are normal indications that the body is developing protection.
There have been reports of very rare but serious cases of blood clots accompanied by low platelet counts (known as thrombosis with thrombocytopenia syndrome (TTS)) occurring 3 to 30 days after vaccination with COVID-19 non-replicant adenovirus vector-based vaccines (such as the AstraZeneca and Janssen vaccines). Read more about the different types of COVID-19 vaccines.
With the AstraZeneca vaccine, as of 15 July 2021, the data shows that these symptoms occur in about four to six people out of every million vaccinated (this figure varies based on age, sex and geographical location). Younger adults appear to be at higher risk than older adults. More research is underway to understand more about how people may be differentially affected.
With the Janssen vaccine, as of 7th May 2021, the US Food and Drug Administration and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention had reviewed 28 reports of TTS out of a total of more than eight million people vaccinated. It is possible that there is a causal link between the vaccine and these symptoms, but more data is needed.
TTS is very rare; however, blood clotting is a common health problem caused by many factors. Not all clots that occur after vaccination with AstraZeneca or the Janssen vaccine will be due to TTS. The risk of blood clots is far higher from COVID-19 itself than from either vaccine.
If you experience a new, severe, persistent headache, blurred vision, chest pain, severe abdominal pain, leg swelling or unusual skin bruising and shortness of breath between three to 30 days following vaccination, contact your doctor immediately. WHO has published interim guidance for clinical case management of TTS following vaccination.
The benefits of the COVID-19 AstraZeneca and Janssen vaccines are far greater than the very small risk of TTS. As well as protecting you from severe disease and death due to COVID-19, being vaccinated can protect you against complications from ‘long COVID’, provide some protection for your close contacts and community by reducing transmission, and can reduce the risk of severe disease from some variant strains. WHO recommends that these vaccines continue to be used to protect priority groups.","['diseas', 'affect', 'johnson', 'occur', 'clot', 'astrazeneca', 'sever', 'adenoviru', 'pain', 'protect', 'peopl', 'risk', 'adult', 'million', 'causal', 'blood', 'leg', 'blur', 'bruis', 'headach', 'due', 'far', 'tt', 'rare', 'covid', 'data', 'janssen', 'vaccin', 'higher', 'platelet']"
427,427,"What are variants of SARS-COV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19?","It is normal for viruses to change and evolve as they spread between people over time. When these changes become significantly different from the original virus, they are known as “variants.” To identify variants, scientists map the genetic material of viruses (known as sequencing) and then look for differences between them to see if they have changed.

431,431,What makes the Omicron variant different from other variants?,"All variants are different. The Omicron variant has a large number of mutations which may mean the virus acts differently from other variants that are circulating.
As of 1 December 2021, there is limited information about Omicron.  Studies are ongoing to determine if there is a change in how easily the virus spreads or the severity of disease it causes, and if there are any impacts on protective measures.
It will likely take time before there will be clear evidence to determine if there is any change in the transmission of Omicron compared to other variants, how the variant responds to existing therapeutics, or whether infection or re-infection with Omicron causes more or less severe disease.
WHO is working with technical partners to understand the potential impact of Omicron on vaccine effectiveness.

438,438,What is ventilation and how can it prevent COVID-19 from spreading?,"Ventilation is the process of bringing fresh, outdoor air inside and letting indoor air outside in order to maintain or improve air quality.
The risk of getting COVID-19 infection is increased in crowded and poorly ventilated settings. This is because the virus passes between people through infected respiratory particles in the form of droplets and aerosols. In poorly ventilated spaces infected aerosols can remain suspended in the air or travel farther  than conversational distance. Improving indoor ventilation reduces the risk of the virus spreading indoors.
Ventilation is not a standalone measure and it should be implemented as part of a comprehensive package of measures, such as physical distancing, avoiding crowds, wearing a mask, frequent hand cleaning, staying home if unwell, coughing or sneezing into a bent elbow, and vaccination. Each of these is important to protect you against COVID-19 infection.","['poorli', 'farther', 'droplet', 'fresh', 'ventil', 'indoor', 'spread', 'comprehens', 'risk', 'outdoor', 'qualiti', 'bring', 'air', 'let', 'standalon', 'bent', 'aerosol', 'elbow', 'distanc', 'convers', 'insid', 'improv', 'suspend', 'viru', 'particl', 'form', 'infect', 'packag', 'measur', 'crowd']"

They are designed to reduce the temperature and humidity of the air, and they do this by recirculating indoor air. Whenever using a wall or window unit air conditioning system, open windows for a few minutes every hour to bring in fresh air from the outside.
Heating, ventilation and air-conditioning (HVAC) systems pull outside air inside. Make sure the settings on your HVAC system maximize the amount of fresh, outdoor air that is pulled into the system.

Provide good ventilation in the room of the ill person and shared spaces, and open windows whenever possible.
Create a cross breeze by opening windows or doors on opposite sides of the ill person’s room.
If possible, try to prevent the air from moving from the sick person’s room to the rest of the house.
If available, the ill person should stay in a separate room that has a private toilet with an air extractor or exhaust fan, which should run at a high speed.

In general, you are at risk of COVID-19 infection whenever you get together with people and risk reduction measures are not in place.  If you meet with others who live outside of your household, WHO recommends meeting outdoors whenever possible. Outdoor venues are safer than indoor venues because there is more air flow and fresh air.

448,448,How can ventilation reduce the risk of contracting COVID-19 in airplanes?,"Most airplanes have cabin air filtration systems equipped with HEPA filters which can remove viruses and germs quickly, reducing risk exposure to any potential infectious virus or bacteria expelled by a cough or sneeze. Cabin air systems are designed to operate most efficiently by delivering approximately 50 percent outside air and 50 percent filtered, recirculated air. The air supply is essentially sterile and particle-free.
However, adequate ventilation is just one of the preventive measures to reduce the risk of COVID-19 transmission.  Other important measures include maintaining a physical distance of at least 1 meter, wearing a mask, cleaning hands frequently, and sneezing/coughing into a bent elbow or tissue, and getting vaccinated when you can.

449,449,What is WHO doing to address ventilation in the context of COVID-19?,"Since January 2020, WHO has provided recommendations on ventilation in COVID-19 guidance. Early in the pandemic, WHO established the WHO Environment and Engineering Control Expert Advisory Panel (ECAP) for COVID-19 to review available scientific evidence and practices and update recommendations on environment and engineering controls. This multidisciplinary network brings together technical experts from various fields, such as infection control specialists, engineers, architects, aerobiologists and environmental experts.
In June 2020, WHO contributed to guidance on ventilation and air-conditioning systems in the context of COVID-19. WHO works closely with the World Meteorological Organization Joint Office for Climate and Health and the United States National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) through the Global Health Information Network to develop and update this guidance. Throughout 2020 and 2021, WHO experts worked to enhance ventilation guidance in a number of technical guidance products for different settings including health facilities, homes, quarantine facilities, schools and businesses. In addition, in March 2021, WHO published a  roadmap to improve ventilation in various settings.

 Whilst your time and resources may be stretched during this health emergency, you have a duty of care to women who may seek help from you – often to address physical and mental hurt caused by violence.  
 You may need to adjust how you deliver services, if face-to-face care is not possible. Depending on your resources consider mobile phone, WhatsApp or other communication channels to deliver support, always ensuring you can do this in a way that is safe for the survivor. Communicate openly with women about any changes in service delivery.  
 If a woman with suspected or confirmed COVID-19 seeks your care because of violence, your response should be the same as for any other survivor. You should however ensure that you are protected from infection, by maintaining distance where possible, wearing protective clothing, practicing respiratory hygiene, and washing hands and surfaces with soap and water regularly and after touching, to avoid infection. 
In any circumstances, including during the COVID-19 pandemic, health workers should provide first-line support, using the LIVES approach to help women survivors of violence:

Violence against women can result in injuries and serious physical, mental, sexual and reproductive health problems, including sexually transmitted infections, HIV, and unplanned pregnancies. In extreme cases, violence against women can result in death. 
The effects of violence are very often long-lived. Violence – in all its forms – can have an impact on a woman’s well-being throughout the rest of her life. This is unacceptable, and the risks of violence that women and their children face during the current COVID-19 crisis cannot be ignored. 
When we are able to prevent violence, or to support women survivors of violence, we help to safeguard women’s human rights, and promote physical and mental health and well-being for women throughout their lives.

463,463,What does it mean to say a virus mutates or changes?,"When a virus replicates or makes copies of itself, it sometimes changes a little bit. These changes are called “mutations.” A virus with one or several new mutations is  referred to as a “variant” of the original virus. 
The more viruses circulate, the more they may change. These changes can occasionally result in a virus variant that is better adapted to its environment compared to the original virus. This process of changing and selection of successful variants is called “virus evolution.”
Some mutations can lead to changes in a virus’s characteristics, such as altered transmission (for example, it may spread more easily) or severity (for example, it may cause more severe disease).
Some viruses change quickly and others more slowly. SARS-CoV-2, the virus which causes COVID-19, tends to change more slowly than others such as HIV or influenza viruses. This could in part be explained by the virus’s internal “proofreading mechanism” which can correct “mistakes” when it makes copies of itself. Scientists continue to study this mechanism to better understand how it works.","['alter', 'bit', 'replic', 'evolut', 'chang', 'variant', 'adapt', 'select', 'occasion', 'origin', 'caus', 'virus', 'sever', 'may', 'littl', 'mistak', 'correct', 'characterist', 'slowli', 'mechan', 'make', 'better', 'influenza', 'mutat', 'viru', 'proofread', 'copi', 'call', 'exampl', 'success']"
464,464,Should I be concerned about SARS-CoV-2 changing?,"It is normal for viruses to change, but it is still something scientists follow closely because there can be important implications. All viruses, including SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, change over time. So far hundreds of variations of this virus have been identified worldwide. WHO and partners have been following them closely since January 2020.
Most changes have little to no impact on the virus’ properties. However, depending on where the changes are located in the virus’s genetic material, they may affect the virus’s properties, such as transmission (for example, it may spread more easily) or severity (for example, it may cause more severe disease).
WHO and its international network of experts, are monitoring changes to the virus so that if significant  mutations are identified, WHO can report any modifications to interventions needed by countries and individuals to prevent the spread of that variant.  The current strategies and measures recommended by WHO continue to work against virus variants identified since the start of the pandemic.
The best way to limit and suppress the transmission of COVID-19 is for people to continue taking the necessary precautions to keep themselves and others safe.","['cov', 'exampl', 'chang', 'sar', 'variant', 'close', 'caus', 'virus', 'transmiss', 'sever', 'spread', 'someth', 'hundr', 'may', 'worldwid', 'littl', 'sinc', 'januari', 'intervent', 'suppress', 'modif', 'continu', 'identifi', 'viru', 'locat', 'network', 'variat', 'follow', 'properti', 'implic']"

Research groups have sequenced SARS-CoV-2 and shared these on public databases, including GISAID. This global collaboration allows scientists to better track the virus and how it is changing.
WHO’s global SARS-CoV-2 laboratory network includes a dedicated SARS-CoV-2 Virus Evolution Working Group, which aims to detect new mutations quickly and assess their possible impact.
WHO recommends that all countries increase the sequencing of SARS-CoV-2 viruses where possible and share sequence data internationally to help one another monitor and respond to the evolving pandemic.

466,466,"How does SARS-CoV-2 change when it infects animals, and what are the implications?","SARS-CoV-2 spreads primarily through human-to-human transmission, but there is evidence of transmission between humans and animals. Several animals like mink, dogs, domestic cats, lions, tigers and raccoon dogs have tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 after contact with infected humans.
There have been reports of large animal outbreaks in mink farms in several countries. SARS-CoV-2 can change while infecting minks. It has been observed that these mink variants are able to transmit back into humans through close contact with the mink. Preliminary results suggest that the mink variants infecting humans appear to have the same properties as other variants of the SARS-CoV-2 virus.
Further research is needed to better understand whether these mink variants will cause sustained transmission among humans and could have a negative impact on countermeasures, such as vaccines.  
WHO works closely with other organizations, such as the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations, and the World Organization for Animal Health, to evaluate situations of SARS-CoV-2 in animals and transmission occurring between animals and humans.","['cov', 'back', 'chang', 'sar', 'variant', 'tiger', 'agricultur', 'close', 'transmiss', 'sever', 'preliminari', 'sustain', 'implic', 'human', 'domest', 'observ', 'organ', 'lion', 'primarili', 'raccoon', 'cat', 'contact', 'anim', 'neg', 'farm', 'mink', 'dog', 'infect', 'properti', 'countermeasur']"

The sick person should be isolated in a room, alone, or at least 1 meter away from others, according to local health authorities’ instructions. No visitors should be permitted to enter the room occupied by the affected guest. Staff should also move people traveling with the sick person to a different room, if possible.
It is usually the relevant public health authority, not the management of the hotel and accommodation establishment, which has the authority to demand sick guests to temporarily remain in their room or to prevent them from receiving visits from other guests. National law will guide the rights of the guests to refuse or not the recommended measures.
Staff entering the room of an ill person should maintain at least a 1 meter distance from the ill person, and request that the ill person put on a medical mask. 
If staff need to assist an ill guest within a 1 meter distance, they should clean their hands before putting on appropriate personal protective equipment (medical mask and eye protection, gloves and isolation gown), and clean their hands after providing assistance.

Excess mortality is defined as the difference between the total number of deaths estimated for a specific place and given time period and the number that would have been expected in the absence of a crisis (e.g., COVID-19 pandemic). This difference is assumed to include deaths attributable directly to COVID-19 as well as deaths indirectly associated with COVID-19 through impacts on health systems and society, minus any deaths that would have occurred under normal circumstances but were averted due to pandemic-related changes in social conditions and personal behaviors.

In general, reported death numbers under-estimate the number of lives lost due to the pandemic, there are several reasons for this. They miss those who died without testing, they are contingent on the country correctly defining COVID as the cause-of-death and they miss the increases in other deaths that are related to the pandemic leading to overwhelmed health systems or patients avoiding care. A few countries have experienced lower than expected total deaths during the pandemic due to reduced contact and reduced mobility, which have led to reduced infectious disease related mortality as well as reduced transport and injury related fatalities. Reported COVID-19 death numbers do not account for this.
In light of the challenges posed by using reported data on COVID-19 cases and deaths, excess mortality is considered a more objective and comparable measure that accounts for both the direct and indirect impacts of the pandemic.","['correctli', 'pandem', 'miss', 'burden', 'mortal', 'light', 'countri', 'case', 'reduc', 'attribut', 'indirect', 'excess', 'account', 'death', 'relat', 'number', 'pose', 'challeng', 'pictur', 'overwhelm', 'due', 'fatal', 'report', 'covid', 'total', 'lost', 'aggreg', 'conting', 'defin', 'measur']"
473,473,Why do the estimates show negative excess deaths for some countries?,"Negative excess deaths could be observed if deaths that would have happened in the absence of the pandemic were averted due to measures taken to deal with the pandemic. Some public health measures (e.g., lockdown, social distancing, mask wearing, working from home) have led to decrease in the number of deaths from causes other than COVID-19. For instance, a decreased number of deaths due to road traffic injuries and seasonal flu has been observed due to restricted movement of people.

474,474,Why are the WHO estimates different from estimates produced by others?,"It is important to note that other groups and countries have produced excess death estimates. The difference in the estimates produced by WHO and those produced by other groups are due to key differences in the input data used and assumptions made including how the expected deaths are calculated, the statistical model used, and the variables used to predict deaths in locations where limited or no data is available. There might also be variations of the period/month/week assessed. To minimize these differences, uncertainty intervals are provided.","['month', 'group', 'period', 'might', 'calcul', 'variabl', 'minim', 'note', 'excess', 'death', 'predict', 'week', 'statist', 'made', 'input', 'interv', 'due', 'estim', 'key', 'expect', 'produc', 'model', 'use', 'data', 'differ', 'limit', 'locat', 'assumpt', 'variat', 'uncertainti']"
475,475,What are the challenges in calculating excess mortality including COVID-19?,"Mortality data to calculate actual deaths in real-time are available in only a subset of countries where reporting systems are functioning effectively, and historical datasets to calculate expected deaths are also often incomplete. Many countries do not have the mortality surveillance capacity to generate and collect data in a timely manner and these data gaps mean that excess mortality cannot be derived for all countries using standard methods.
The work of the TAG has been essential to establishing the methodology to model excess deaths where data has been unavailable and/or incomplete. This methodology is still under development and will likely be revised based on Member State feedback during the country consultation process.","['methodolog', 'manner', 'deriv', 'dataset', 'function', 'consult', 'capac', 'revis', 'collect', 'mortal', 'calcul', 'surveil', 'excess', 'death', 'real', 'gap', 'unavail', 'incomplet', 'challeng', 'actual', 'time', 'method', 'expect', 'tag', 'subset', 'model', 'data', 'histor', 'feedback', 'countri']"
476,476,Where can I review the methodology used to calculate the estimates for each country?,"In light of the evolving situation surrounding the COVID-19 pandemic, the estimates will be updated periodically as more data becomes available.","['methodolog', 'becom', 'aadhaar', 'period', 'abroad', 'pandem', 'light', 'evolv', 'calcul', 'avail', 'updat', 'abattoir', 'aarogya', 'situat', 'abhishek', 'abnorm', 'abid', 'abridg', 'review', 'estim', 'covid', 'abdomin', 'data', 'use', 'abil', 'abl', 'abruptli', 'countri', 'surround', 'abort']"

478,478,Is a ‘one size fits all’ model used to produce excess mortality estimates?,"WHO produces estimates using statistical modeling for all global health estimates, often with the advice of technical experts, to ensure robust statistical standards are followed and facilitate global comparability. This is the standard approach followed also by other UN agencies for global estimates. The model adopted for estimating excess deaths is not a ‘one-size-fits-all’ approach. WHO in collaboration with the TAG scrutinizes the relationships between excess mortality and certain contextually relevant variables in locations with good quality data to estimate excess mortality in countries with limited data.
This approach takes the specificity of countries (e.g., income level, reported COVID-19 deaths rate, test positivity rate, containment index) into consideration while ensuring global comparability. Countries may have their own approach to estimating excess deaths that may produce results that are different from those produced by WHO.","['fit', 'un', 'global', 'mortal', 'contextu', 'scrutin', 'variabl', 'facilit', 'incom', 'excess', 'death', 'statist', 'adopt', 'rate', 'ensur', 'standard', 'approach', 'compar', 'estim', 'index', 'produc', 'tag', 'model', 'data', 'robust', 'one', 'size', 'countri', 'follow', 'agenc']"
479,479,How are countries grouped in Tier 1 or 2 for the estimation approach?,"Tier classification is a simple grouping of countries based on mortality data availability. Countries are classified as Tier 1 countries if complete and nationally representative monthly all-cause mortality data for the specified period have been made available to WHO. Countries categorized as Tier 2 include countries for which WHO does not have access to the complete data and thus requires the use of alternative data sources or the application of scaling factors to generate the national aggregate. For these countries, WHO also utilizes subnational data where available. 
 Tier classification is not a classification of health systems but one specific for and only applied to this current exercise. It is not a reflection of the public health advancement of a country nor of the legislation in place for mortality surveillance. It concretely takes into consideration clear inclusion and exclusion criteria based on data that have been made available to WHO.","['repres', 'group', 'monthli', 'simpl', 'categor', 'mortal', 'specifi', 'concret', 'avail', 'reflect', 'criterion', 'applic', 'thu', 'made', 'exclus', 'util', 'classif', 'inclus', 'subnat', 'complet', 'base', 'classifi', 'legisl', 'scale', 'tier', 'data', 'aggreg', 'nation', 'altern', 'countri']"
480,480,How are countries grouped to determine the age-sex pattern of excess deaths?,"In order to determine age-sex patterns of excess deaths, countries are categorized into eight groups using a K-means clustering approach. While a natural grouping would be geographically representative, using some regional identification (e.g., WHO regions), from a practical perspective it is not always possible owing to insufficient availability of empirical data in some countries or regions. Even within close geographic proximity, the impact of the pandemic, and its magnitude by sex and age can vary significantly. 
K-means is a method commonly used to characterize data and partition a data set into groups. Countries are grouped into clusters based on mean ages at death and of population, as well as the overall excess mortality rates and proportion of total deaths. The number of clusters is chosen to maximise the variation between clusters and to minimise the variation within clusters by age and sex.","['within', 'determin', 'group', 'maximis', 'cluster', 'owe', 'character', 'eight', 'perspect', 'magnitud', 'categor', 'identif', 'region', 'partit', 'insuffici', 'excess', 'minimis', 'death', 'pattern', 'mean', 'age', 'proxim', 'variat', 'sex', 'chosen', 'data', 'use', 'geograph', 'empir', 'countri']"
481,481,What are the limitations of these estimates and methods?,"Every model is an approximation of reality. Models are subject to trade-offs, not least, the balance between comprehensiveness and comprehensibility. WHO’s estimates of the excess mortality associated with the COVID-19 pandemic are also approximations in a rapidly evolving pandemic with regard to transmissibility and severity. It is worth noting that WHO relies on models to compile a wide range of global health statistics. This is necessary as not all countries have high quality information systems, or those that do cannot always share their data in a timely manner. Therefore, WHO works with countries to strengthen their data and health information systems, while at the same time makes the best use of the data currently available to generate high quality evidence.
Specifically with regard to the excess mortality estimates, the model uses relationships that have been quantified using data from the countries with high quality systems for data reporting. We extrapolate these relationships to settings that are in many ways systematically different across multiple dimensions such as health systems capacity, underlying disease burden and age-structure. Countries have differed on when they experienced waves and how they responded, and quantifying this temporal relationships between COVID-19 surges or the effects of the emergence of variants is not trivial. In some settings the country responses were reactive but in many others they were proactive. As such, despite the effort to calibrate the model such that it is accurate in different settings, one of the more important limitations to note is that the input data have limited representation and this model generalizes the covariate relationships quantified to settings that may be systematically different from those observed. The final model is intentionally parsimonious. This reduction in complexity means it is not possible for such a reduced set of variables to explain all of the variation that is observed across countries. While the variables chosen are contextually relevant and are found to explain a significant component of the variation in excess, the underlying population characteristics that drove these differences are too complex to fully capture perfectly in a single global model and, hence, the trade-offs referred to above have had to be made. The estimates, therefore, are the best possible at this point in time for the first 24 months of the pandemic and have some degree of uncertainty around them.","['quantifi', 'pandem', 'explain', 'relationship', 'mortal', 'countri', 'regard', 'variabl', 'note', 'best', 'comprehens', 'excess', 'qualiti', 'systemat', 'underli', 'complex', 'observ', 'trade', 'estim', 'model', 'data', 'differ', 'limit', 'system', 'therefor', 'set', 'high', 'approxim', 'variat', 'across']"
482,482,What process did the WHO follow to calculate the estimates?,"In February 2021, in collaboration with the United Nations Department of Economic and Social Affairs (UN DESA), WHO convened a Technical Advisory Group (TAG) on COVID-19 Mortality Assessment to advise on the development of analytical methods for estimating excess mortality in all countries. The COVID TAG is composed of leading demographers, epidemiologists, data and social scientists and statisticians from a range of backgrounds and geographies.
Under Working Group I of the TAG (Working Group I: Global excess mortality estimates including COVID-19), members considered several statistical models and after assessing performance, interpretability as well as extensibility, the TAG proposed a Poisson regression model (parameterized to account for over-dispersion) to predict the total number of deaths from all causes for the years 2020 and 2021, conditional on the monthly expected deaths over the period and a predicted relative rate parameter which is modeled using country-specific variables.
The model has been used by WHO to generate estimates for countries and regions for which adequate input data were available for reliable inference and to predict estimates for countries with no data available. In addition to determining levels of excess mortality associated with the COVID-19 pandemic for the years 2020 and 2021, the expertise of the TAG is also being leveraged to develop methods for disaggregating the estimated number of excess deaths by age and sex.
WHO’s estimates are produced following the Guidelines for Accurate and Transparent Health Estimates Reporting (GATHER).","['social', 'year', 'group', 'ass', 'monthli', 'desa', 'disaggreg', 'paramet', 'mortal', 'geographi', 'compos', 'affair', 'excess', 'poisson', 'death', 'predict', 'number', 'leverag', 'dispers', 'regress', 'estim', 'method', 'analyt', 'tag', 'model', 'data', 'statistician', 'parameter', 'infer', 'countri']"
483,483,What is a country consultation process and what countries are consulted on?,"It is a regular process that WHO consults with its Member States when producing new estimates. In August 2021, a Circular Letter (C.L. 29.2021) was shared through WHO’s official list of addresses with all Member States requesting the designation of a national focal point to interact with the technical team in this process. 
Designated focal points for each Member State were requested to review estimates of excess mortality associated with the COVID-19 pandemic, the data sources and methods used and, to share primary data sources that may not have been previously available to WHO. Any additional feedback is also taken into consideration during the country consultation.
In October 2021, the draft estimates of excess mortality associated with the COVID-19 pandemic prepared for each country and the methodology applied to produce these estimates, were made available for download and accessible through WHO’s Country Portal.  The WHO estimates of excess mortality associated with the COVID-19 pandemic provide a comprehensive and comparable set of country estimates disaggregated by sex and age from January 2020 to December 2021.
Designated national focal points reviewed and uploaded supporting data and provided feedback on estimates via the WHO Country Portal. National focal points interacted with the WHO Global Health Estimates team. Regional webinars and a Mission Briefing (for Permanent Missions in Geneva) were organized to present the estimates and methodology and provided opportunity to respond to any questions.

484,484,What is WHO's guidance on certifying COVID-19 deaths?,"A death due to COVID-19 is defined for surveillance purposes as a death resulting from a clinically compatible illness, in a probable or confirmed COVID-19 case, unless there is a clear alternative cause of death that cannot be related to COVID disease (e.g. trauma). There should be no period of complete recovery from COVID-19 between illness and death. A death due to COVID-19 may not be attributed to another disease (e.g. cancer) and should be counted independently of preexisting conditions that are suspected of triggering a severe course of COVID-19.

485,485,How is WHO supporting countries to strengthen national health information systems?,"At the heart of WHO’s Transformation Agenda is a commitment to support countries to strengthen their data and health information systems and make progress towards achieving the Triple Billion targets and health-related SDGs.
The SCORE for Health Data Technical Package (Survey, Count, Optimize, Review, Enable) identifies data gaps and provides countries with tools to close them. Based on findings from the first assessment of country health data and information systems, WHO is using an integrated approach to improve public health and disease surveillance, track Civil Registration and Vital Statistics (CRVS) data, and optimize routine health information systems, including regular and reliable data from health facilities.
The following tools are available to countries:
The World Health Survey Plus (WHS+) is a multi-topic, multi-mode, multi-platform survey tool to gather health data quickly in standardized and cost effective ways to assess and improve health.
The CRVS strategic implementation plan is focused on supporting countries so that over the next five years there will be substantial progress with accurate and timely tracking of births, deaths, and causes of death.
WHO’s Routine Health Information Systems (RHIS) strategy aims to strengthen RHIS in countries through strengthened partnerships, improved data collection, and improved integration and interoperability of RHIS, along with building capacity and ensuring sustainability.
The WHO Toolkit for Routine Health Information Systems Data strengthens facility data analysis through standardized indicators, visualizations, and guidance, while promoting integrated routing data platforms.
The WHO Harmonized Health Facility Assessment (HHFA) is a comprehensive facility survey providing data on the availability of health services and the resources and systems needed to improve quality.
These data solutions enable public health decision makers to improve essential health services and better respond to emergencies.

486,486,"Why is WHO producing these estimates now, in the midst of the pandemic, and what is its utility?","WHO’s core normative function is to compile and disseminate statistics on mortality – numbers and causes. The world expects WHO to provide objective evidence on the impact of COVID-19.
Estimating excess mortality associated with the COVID-19 pandemic supplements the traditional direct measure ‘mortality directly attributable to COVID-19’ with a broader measure showing the direct plus the indirect effects of the pandemic. 
It is important to do this now, rather than wait, in order to underpin the need for an equitable response during the pandemic by showing the real underlying impact of COVID-19 in different countries – especially lower and middle income countries that may not have developed health information systems to guide a targeted response.
Deaths directly attributable to COVID-19 provide only a narrow perspective of the wide ranging harms being caused by the pandemic. The collateral damage from COVID-19 is much wider. It is important to quantify this now as it can inform choices that governments must make regarding prioritization between routine and emergency health systems.
The utility of the excess mortality estimates goes beyond estimation of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. It underlines the significance of investing in health and better targeting of interventions and resources to those most in need to prevent future deaths. These estimates will serve to underscore to governments around the world the need to sharpen their data tools and specifically improve Civil Registration and Vital Statistics (CRVS), mortality surveillance, and data and health information systems.
Estimates of excess mortality associated with the COVID-19 pandemic are also critical inputs for other important work currently underway. For example, pandemic preparedness and estimating the global population. The UN is mandated to estimate the global population and prepare population projections. COVID-19 is a significant disruption to normal population growth trends and must be factored into any future estimates. Global excess mortality associated with the COVID-19 pandemic provides a key input to this work, showing the effects of the pandemic on the global population now, but also the longer tail effects on future population projections. The importance of this should not be underestimated as population is one of the most important denominators for economic and social statistics.","['popul', 'pandem', 'global', 'mortal', 'impact', 'inform', 'collater', 'attribut', 'project', 'excess', 'target', 'import', 'statist', 'direct', 'util', 'input', 'estim', 'health', 'futur', 'govern', 'covid', 'associ', 'effect', 'must', 'directli', 'system', 'show', 'signific', 'need', 'provid']"
487,487,How is this work related to other global health and population estimates?,"The COVID-19 pandemic will have long lasting impacts on the structure of populations brought by changes in deaths and births. Substantial increases in mortality in many countries have affected premature mortality and life expectancy. WHO’s excess mortality estimates are critical inputs to WHO global health estimates and other UN partners’ work, including UN World Population Prospects.
The excess mortality estimates associated with the COVID-19 pandemic provide a valuable set of comparable country estimates to better understand the impact of the pandemic. It is thus of vital importance that these estimates are made available in a timely manner and updated periodically in order to identify inequalities and gaps in health information systems and civil registration and vital statistics (CRVS), which in turn will help in determining likely future vulnerabilities and target interventions.

499,499,"What is meant by a ‘convention, agreement or other international instrument’?","Conventions, framework agreements and treaties are all examples of international instruments, which are legal agreements made between countries that are binding.  
There are international instruments addressing a broad range of topics, including tobacco control, nuclear, chemical and biological weapons, climate change and many other threats to our shared security and well-being.
A key international instrument on international health, rooted in the WHO Constitution, is the  International Health Regulations (2005), which was established “to prevent, protect against, control and provide a public health response to the international spread of disease in ways that are commensurate with and restricted to public health risks, and which avoid unnecessary interference with international traffic and trade”.","['instrument', 'traffic', 'unnecessari', 'interfer', 'biolog', 'convent', 'framework', 'treati', 'bind', 'commensur', 'chemic', 'legal', 'root', 'topic', 'broad', 'constitut', 'weapon', 'threat', 'trade', 'secur', 'public', 'health', 'climat', 'intern', 'regul', 'agreement', 'meant', 'tobacco', 'control', 'nuclear']"
500,500,Why did WHO’s Member States decide to create an accord for pandemic preparedness and response?,"In light of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, WHO’s 194 Member States established a process to draft and negotiate a new convention, agreement, or other international instrument (referred to in the rest of this FAQ, generally, as an “accord”) on pandemic preparedness and response. This was driven by the need to ensure communities, governments, and all sectors of society – within countries and globally – are better prepared and protected, in order to prevent and respond to future pandemics. The great loss of human life, disruption to households and societies at large, and impact on development are among the factors cited by governments to support the need for lasting action to prevent a repeat of such crises.
At the heart of the proposed accord is the need to ensure equity in both access to the tools needed to prevent pandemics (including technologies like vaccines, personal protective equipment, information and expertise) and access to health care for all people.","['prepared', 'negoti', 'instrument', 'cite', 'accord', 'pandem', 'propos', 'convent', 'draft', 'access', 'disrupt', 'impact', 'equiti', 'societi', 'driven', 'state', 'repeat', 'ensur', 'member', 'sector', 'govern', 'expertis', 'crise', 'agreement', 'prevent', 'decid', 'need', 'great', 'faq', 'respons']"
501,501,Why are such international agreements and instruments needed in global public health?,"WHO Member States have developed multiple global legally-binding agreements, conventions, accords, and other types of international instruments to protect and promote people’s health, including the WHO Constitution itself, the WHO Framework Convention on Tobacco Control, and the International Health Regulations.
Such instruments were created by Member States to secure and foster further collaboration in multiple areas that impact on the health and well-being of people in communities, countries and globally.
These international instruments represent a commitment by countries of the world to address the health needs of their citizens to advance their health status and strengthen the socio-economic status of their communities at large.","['repres', 'instrument', 'commun', 'statu', 'convent', 'framework', 'collabor', 'global', 'bind', 'legal', 'promot', 'strengthen', 'commit', 'state', 'address', 'econom', 'constitut', 'socio', 'member', 'multipl', 'secur', 'health', 'foster', 'intern', 'regul', 'agreement', 'citizen', 'tobacco', 'need', 'countri']"
502,502,What is the process underway to draft and negotiate the accord?,"The process to consider such an international accord for pandemic prevention, preparedness and response is being led fully by countries – WHO’s Member States.
In December 2021, WHO’s Member States decided at a special session of the World Health Assembly – WHO’s highest decision-making body, comprised of all of its 194 sovereign member countries – to establish an intergovernmental negotiating body (INB), representing all regions of the world, to draft and negotiate a WHO convention, agreement, or other international instrument on pandemic prevention, preparedness and response, with a view to adoption under Article 19 of the WHO Constitution, or other provisions of the Constitution as may be deemed appropriate by the INB.
Article 19 gives the 194 Member States forming the World Health Assembly the authority to adopt conventions or agreements on any matter within WHO’s competence. The sole instrument established under Article 19 to date is the  WHO Framework Convention on Tobacco Control, which has made a significant and rapid contribution to protecting people from tobacco since its entry into force in 2005.
The World Health Assembly decision establishing the Intergovernmental Negotiating Body (INB) and its work on this new international accord stressed that WHO’s Member States, who will be working in their sovereign capacity, should guide their efforts to develop the new accord by the principle of solidarity with all people and countries, and the accord should frame practical actions to deal with both causes and consequences of pandemics and other health emergencies.
The INB has been requested to deliver a progress report to the 76th World Health Assembly in 2023 and submit its outcome for consideration by the 77th World Health Assembly in 2024.","['prepared', 'negoti', 'compet', 'intergovernment', 'instrument', 'accord', 'pandem', 'convent', 'frame', 'inb', 'draft', 'th', 'articl', 'world', 'adopt', 'state', 'constitut', 'establish', 'member', 'sovereign', 'health', 'decis', 'bodi', 'intern', 'compris', 'agreement', 'assembl', 'tobacco', 'process', 'countri']"
503,503,What is the role of the WHO Secretariat role in the accord process?,"In December 2021, WHO’s Member States requested the WHO Director-General to convene the meetings of the Intergovernmental Negotiating Body and support its work, including by facilitating the participation of other United Nations system bodies, non-state actors, and other relevant stakeholders in the process to the extent decided by the 194 Member States forming part of the negotiations.
The WHO Secretariat’s job is to support countries – its Member States – as they negotiate and agree on the new international accord. The WHO Secretariat does not determine the contents of any possible international accord.","['request', 'negoti', 'support', 'intergovernment', 'director', 'determin', 'accord', 'unit', 'agre', 'particip', 'facilit', 'extent', 'state', 'member', 'job', 'meet', 'bodi', 'content', 'conven', 'intern', 'decemb', 'role', 'relev', 'non', 'process', 'decid', 'form', 'secretariat', 'actor', 'stakehold']"
504,504,Who else is involved in the process for the accord?,"Besides WHO Member States, the process for developing a possible new accord has provided extensive opportunities for engagement with relevant stakeholders, including other United Nations system bodies, and a wide range of other non-State actors in official relations with the WHO, to ensure robust and inclusive participation in the proceedings of the Intergovernmental Negotiating Body. Furthermore, WHO has sought complementary inputs through public hearings, with stakeholders including: international organizations; civil society; the private sector; philanthropic organizations; scientific, medical, public policy and academic institutions and other entities with relevant knowledge, experience and/or expertise.","['negoti', 'intergovernment', 'complementari', 'accord', 'philanthrop', 'engag', 'academ', 'hear', 'el', 'state', 'inclus', 'sector', 'civil', 'organ', 'knowledg', 'input', 'public', 'bodi', 'proceed', 'extens', 'robust', 'entiti', 'expertis', 'besid', 'relev', 'furthermor', 'process', 'sought', 'actor', 'stakehold']"
505,505,"What could the accord on pandemic prevention, preparedness and response do?","As the process of the Intergovernmental Negotiating Body is solely the decision of WHO’s 194 sovereign Member States, WHO’s Member States will ultimately determine the form and content of the new accord, including its objectives, principle(s), and scope.
The new accord could represent a global commitment to work together, as an international community, to help prevent disease outbreaks from impacting individuals, communities, countries and the world in the same way as the COVID-19 pandemic did.
Importantly, any new accord would be expected to establish principles, priorities and targets for pandemic preparedness and response, with the aim to:
build resilience to pandemics;
support prevention, detection, and responses to outbreaks with pandemic potential;
ensure equitable access to pandemic countermeasures; and
support global coordination through a stronger and more accountable WHO.
The new accord could complement other initiatives, actions and measures aimed at making the world safer from pandemics, including the  International Health Regulations and global institutions and systems working to equitably share health technologies, information and expertise.
The proposed accord could take the lessons learned from the COVID-19 pandemic and use them to build back better. Equity is one of the key principles being discussed as part of the work on the new accord.
A new accord could promote political commitment at the highest level, through ensuring an all-of-government and whole-of-society approach within countries, and sustained and sufficient political and financial investment within and among countries.

506,506,What gaps could such an accord address?,"Among other things, the new accord could, if WHO’s Member States so decide, address gaps that have been highlighted by the COVID-19 pandemic, including the following key areas for action:
global preparedness and response arrangements – including at the human-animal interface – to help anticipate and prevent future pandemics and address them more effectively when they do arise;
sustained, predictable funding for health emergency preparedness and response, including from domestic budgets to support preparedness measures and help ensure that the world is prepared and can respond to the emergence of dangerous pathogens; and
governance and oversight mechanisms to increase trust, ensure accountability and foster transparency.","['prepared', 'accord', 'aris', 'help', 'pandem', 'fund', 'anticip', 'sustain', 'emerg', 'danger', 'predict', 'gap', 'ensur', 'address', 'highlight', 'domest', 'mechan', 'respond', 'budget', 'oversight', 'foster', 'transpar', 'includ', 'anim', 'interfac', 'pathogen', 'decid', 'could', 'arrang', 'respons']"
507,507,How will the new accord relate to the International Health Regulations (IHR)?,"The International Health Regulations (2005) (the “IHR”) are a key international instrument on international health, rooted in the WHO Constitution. The IHR were established to prevent, protect against, control and provide a public health response to the international spread of disease in ways that are commensurate with and restricted to public health risks, and which avoid unnecessary interference with international traffic and trade.
The work on the new accord on pandemic prevention, preparedness and response would aim to be coherent with, and complement, the IHR.
The IHR are also under a process, established by the 194 Member States forming part of the World Health Assembly in May 2022, of potential “targeted” amendments, through a separate Member-State led Working Group process which will hold its first organizational meeting no later than 15 November 2022.

508,508,"The proposed accord may focus on “pandemics”; is that term internationally defined, and how do “pandemics” fit with the International Health Regulations (IHR)?","It could be anticipated that a new accord could define the term “pandemic” as part of its terms, to ensure clarity with respect to its scope of application, if Member States so decide. It is also possible that the new accord could include a provision on its relationship with other international instruments, including clarifying that the new accord could be complementary to the IHR. Article 57 of the IHR also states that its Parties may conclude special treaties or arrangements in order to facilitate the implementation of the IHR.","['instrument', 'complementari', 'accord', 'pandem', 'clarifi', 'scope', 'propos', 'treati', 'relationship', 'ihr', 'anticip', 'articl', 'parti', 'facilit', 'special', 'applic', 'state', 'conclud', 'clariti', 'respect', 'provis', 'term', 'intern', 'regul', 'defin', 'decid', 'could', 'focu', 'arrang', 'new']"
509,509,"How can citizens and the general public keep informed of what happens at the Intergovernmental Negotiating Body, and of our government’s decisions and positions?","The Intergovernmental Negotiating Body is, per the World Health Assembly decision, operating based on the principles of inclusiveness, transparency, efficiency, Member State leadership and consensus. Public updates will be provided at all relevant steps of the process.
Member States meet in person on a regular basis as part of the Intergovernmental Negotiating Body (INB).
Member States convening as part of the INB conducted the first phase of their important work between February and June 2022 with the aim to agree on the way they would work, and to define how best to engage various stakeholders in an inclusive manner. The INB shared the report of this first phase of its work through a global public live webcast.
Member States start the second phase of their work as part of the INB in July 2022.  It is foreseen that some sessions of future meetings will also be webcast, based on decisions by the negotiating body. The second meeting of the INB (18-22 July 2022) will be webcast.

510,510,How much authority could an accord have over signatory countries? Will it be legally binding? Will it take sovereignty away from signatory countries?,"The working draft presented based on progress achieved for the second meeting of the Intergovernmental Negotiating Body (INB) illustrates a number of potential principles for the new accord, including the importance of national sovereign rights and full respect for the dignity, human rights and fundamental freedoms of persons.
As with all international instruments, any new accord, if and when agreed by Member States, would be determined by governments themselves, who would take any action while considering their own national laws and regulations.
Member States will decide the terms of the accord, including whether any of its provisions will be legally binding on Member States as a matter of international law.
It is expected that such an accord would aim to help prevent future disease outbreaks from impinging on people’s freedom to travel, work, seek education and, above all, lead a healthy life free of avoidable disease, as called for by another global accord, the WHO Constitution.

565,565,Why do I need a vaccination certificate?,"
A COVID Vaccine Certificate (CVC) issued by the government offers an assurance to the beneficiary on the vaccination, type of vaccine used, and the certificate also provides the next vaccination due. It also is an evidence for the beneficiary to prove to any entities which may require proof of vaccination especially in case of travel. Vaccination not only protects individuals from disease, but also reduces their risk of spreading the virus. Therefore, there could be a requirement in future to produce certificates for certain kinds of social interactions and international travel.
In this context the certificate issued by Co-WIN has built in security features to guarantee genuineness of the certificate which can be digitally verified using approved utilities which are provided in the Co-WIN portal. The certificates can be verified by visiting verify.cowin.gov.in and scanning the QR code.","['certif', 'beneficiari', 'travel', 'win', 'built', 'portal', 'issu', 'featur', 'assur', 'util', 'also', 'code', 'guarante', 'proof', 'secur', 'cvc', 'verifi', 'scan', 'entiti', 'kind', 'next', 'vaccin', 'gov', 'genuin', 'co', 'cowin', 'prove', 'provid', 'qr', 'requir']"

586,586,A majority of the population has been immunised against Covid-19. What is the vaccine effectiveness against these emerging sub-variants?,"BA.2 played a major role in the third wave of Covid-19 in India. Most of the population in India is immunised against the virus because of its highly successful vaccination programme. Besides, the three waves mean that a majority of people have been exposed to either a vaccine-mediated or an infection-mediated immunity. Hence to infect such a population, the virus needs to evade immunity. Antibodies against the surface spike proteins of SARS-CoV-2 protect a person against infection. Mutations can change the shape of certain parts of spike proteins, rendering the antibodies developed after vaccination or infection ineffective. This leads to reinfection/breakthrough infection. The virus is continuously evolving and in addition to the mutation present in BA.2, these three, BA.2.74, BA.2.75, and BA.2.76, have had additional mutations in their genome coding for spike proteins. These three sub-variants have had more than nine changes in the spike protein and are driving the surge in Covid infections. Two mutations, G4465 and R493 are the key changes in BA.2.75. These have been identified this week, so studies are essential to ascertain vaccine effectiveness against these emerging sub-variants. However, as these new sub-variants are detected in RT-PCR-positive patients in the current surge, their immune-escape potential is already established.

590,590,What is the closest parallel to what we are seeing in the U.S.? ,"The U.K. is the closest, but the U.K. itself is so far removed from what we are seeing in the U.S. here, said Venky Soundararajan, chief scientific officer at research company Nference. 

Soundararajan recently worked with National Institutes of Health scientists to publish research in PNAS Nexus quantifying the distinctiveness of variants, relative to those that have spread previously within a specific region of the world. The authors found that this new metric could predict variations in future increases in variants in different parts of the world, depending on which variants had previously spread in those regions. 

Soundararajan cited the wide gap in new COVID-19 cases during March between the two countries, when the U.K. reported a sharp increase in BA.2 infections at a time when cases in the U.S. were largely slowing. Their metric suggests that while BA.5's significant growth advantage will fuel a surge in cases, the immunity wall built up during the winter wave suggests the current wave will not reach the same record heights.

BA.5 Omicron is not significantly distinct in the U.S., from what we have seen, particularly with BA.2.12.1 which was the most recent subtype that circulated. And BA.1 continues to provide a level of extremely high exposure which we suspect will continue to play out through the summer, added Soundararajan. 

Even as the pace of COVID-19 hospitalizations has accelerated around the country, measurements of some of the worst outcomes of the disease remain far lower than during some previous waves in the pandemic. 

Only a relatively small percentage of hospital intensive care unit beds around the country are taken up by COVID-19 patients. The pace of new COVID-19 deaths remains worse than at this time last year, at an unacceptable average of more than 300 deaths per day. But, even among more vulnerable groups like nursing home residents, COVID-19's daily death toll remains a fraction of some previous waves.

591,591,Concerns have been raised because now in India  and there are a few cases in the states there’s the subsequent BA.2.75. Is that going to overtake BA.4 and BA.5? ,"That’s the risky side of the game. Krilov said it’s somewhat similar to how flu vaccines are created on an annual basis. There is some guesswork trying to predict what the circulating strains, in this case variants, are going to be and get the best match we can, he said. 

In the years we have a good flu vaccine match, we get 60-plus percent protection. The years we don't have as good a match, it’s lower, but it's still something in preventing against severe disease. So, I think there's a good chance. It will be helpful. How helpful, I guess, based on this variation, makes it a little too hard to say right now. Both Syed and Krilov pointed out that vaccines and boosters are vital tools because even if they do not completely prevent infection from the virus, they protect against severe illness, hospitalization and death.

When the original Omicron variant swept across the country this winter, it launched America into a new COVID era, one in which nearly everyone95 percent of adults, according to one CDC estimatehas some immunity to the virus through vaccines, infection, or both. Since then, however, Omicron subvariants have still managed to cause big waves of infection. They’ve accomplished this by eroding our existing immunity. 

This will keep happening. There’s not a lot of things I’m confident about in SARS-CoV-2 evolution, but I think I’m extremely confident we’ll keep seeing new variants that are progressively eroding antibody neutralization, says Jesse Bloom, an evolutionary virologist at the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Center. Experts are cautiously optimistic that the pace of variant emergence will eventually slow, and for many people, reinfections are already milder and hospitals are not overwhelmed. But as the virus keeps changing, the only real guarantee is that it will be differentand that its changes won’t necessarily affect everyone uniformly.

592,592,Omicron was so different and so unusual compared with everything that had come before. Could it happen again?,"Most people think probably not but … you don’t want to be burned twice. Whether an Omicron-like event happens every two or 20 or 200 years can mean different trajectories for COVID’s future. But at this point, we have only two and a half years of data to go on, so prognosticate at your own risk. 

More predictably, though, SARS-CoV-2 is likely to make smaller gains over time, accumulating mutations that make it incrementally better at reinfection. Virologists call this antigenic evolution. (Antigenic refers to the parts of a pathogen recognized by our immune system. For SARS-CoV-2, this is predominantly the spike protein.) Different viruses do seem capable of different rates of antigenic evolution. Of the four seasonal coronaviruses that cause common colds, for example, OC43 and 229E are evolving at a rate of 0.3 to 0.5 adaptive mutations in their spike proteins each year. But a third, NL63, doesn’t seem to be changing much at all, says Kathryn Kistler, a virologist also at Fred Hutch who has studied the evolution of the seasonal coronaviruses. She is currently trying to confirm this with blood-serum samples collected in the ’80s and ’90s. And there are so few samples of the fourth coronavirus, HKU1, that we don’t have enough to discern any trend.","['sampl', 'omicron', 'year', 'evolut', 'two', 'hutch', 'accumul', 'hku', 'fred', 'discern', 'predominantli', 'seem', 'trajectori', 'spike', 'rate', 'burn', 'protein', 'coronavirus', 'antigen', 'virologist', 'kathryn', 'oc', 'prognost', 'season', 'kistler', 'differ', 'mutat', 'happen', 'increment', 'nl']"
593,593,"Instead of always trying to catch up to the virus though, could we broaden our immunity and get ahead of it?","Our current vaccines, while still very good at protecting against severe disease, are not capable of this. The White House is now promotingthough not really fundingnext-generation vaccines that could potentially do better: pan-coronavirus vaccines that scientists hope will elicit antibodies against parts of the spike protein that do not change very much, or nasal vaccines to elicit antibodies in the nose and mouth where the virus first replicates, perhaps stopping an infection altogether.

But these ideas are not new to SARS-CoV-2researchers have been trying these approaches to flu for many years. A universal flu vaccine is still elusive. A nasal flu vaccine, FluMist, does exist, but its effectiveness is quite mixed: It was originally thought to be more effective than the shot, then believed to be less effectiveso much so that the CDC pulled the vaccine from 2016 to 2018until it was reformulated. In any case, it’s clear that FluMist doesn’t come close to preventing all mild flu infections.

597,597,How are Delta and Omicron different? Can someone be affected by both at the same time?,"The distinguishing characteristic in Omicron is that there is absence of breathing difficulty in compared to the Delta strain where even the patients in the ward were requiring oxygen support, Dr Abhishek asserted. It is important to note that the Delta strain is still there and people could be infected with both these strains. So, symptoms will vary accordingly, Dr Abhishek mentioned.

598,598,How much more infectious is the Delta variant? How is it able to do that?,"According to an internal CDC document, the Delta variant one of four variants of concern that have evolved from SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19 is more than twice as infectious as the original virus and as infectious as chickenpox. Its high infectiousness could be due to its ability to replicate rapidly in the body. A study from China reported that people infected with the Delta variant can carry 1,000 times the viral load as those infected with the original virus. To me, that’s shocking, said Roan. That study also found that people infected with the Delta variant carry detectable virus earlier than with the original virus (four days versus six days after exposure) and another study found that they remain infectious longer (18 days versus 13 days). 

Not only is it replicating more, it’s replicating faster, and that’s probably why it’s able to spread so much more efficiently, said Roan. That efficiency comes down to the molecular details. We know that the Delta variant carries multiple mutations, including within the spike protein which it uses to latch onto and enter cells. Of particular note, said Roan, is a spike protein mutation at what’s known as the furin cleavage site. This site is important for priming or activating newly replicated viruses to begin infecting cells. Unpublished studies suggest that the original virus primes about 50 percent of its viruses, whereas the Delta variant primes more than 75 percent. 

That might potentially explain why it’s able to transmit much more efficiently and why the viral loads are so much higher, although other mutations that Delta accumulated could very well contribute also, said Roan.","['infecti', 'much', 'replic', 'percent', 'variant', 'origin', 'cell', 'virus', 'viral', 'spike', 'delta', 'prime', 'load', 'carri', 'versu', 'day', 'roan', 'wherea', 'protein', 'said', 'found', 'four', 'latch', 'effici', 'studi', 'abl', 'mutat', 'viru', 'site', 'infect']"
599,599,Does the Delta variant cause more serious disease?,"There’s not yet consensus on whether the Delta variant makes people sicker. The internal CDC document cited studies from Canada and Singapore (not yet peer-reviewed) that found higher odds of hospitalization and death, and a study from Scotland that found double the risk of hospitalization compared to the Alpha variant, which had been the dominant variant in the U.S. before Delta’s rise. This is concerning as the Alpha variant was already demonstrated to cause more severe COVID-19 than the original virus, said Roan.

600,600,What are breakthrough infections and are they more common with the Delta variant?,"A breakthrough infection is an infection in a fully vaccinated person. They can occur if the body fails to mount a strong enough immune response to prevent an infection. Overall, all the vaccines remain highly effective at preventing severe illness and death from the Delta variant. For example, various studies have reported the Pfizer vaccine to be 93 to 100 percent effective against hospitalization and death, with somewhat lower effectiveness, 64 to 88 percent, against all symptomatic disease.

A recent analysis of breakthrough cases among UCSF employees and staff since Delta's rise showed that unvaccinated people remain five times more likely to become infected than people who are vaccinated, and 25 times more likely to be hospitalized. While it’s not entirely clear why there are more breakthrough infections with the Delta variant, I would guess the high viral load is a big part of the equation, said Roan. 

When you’re essentially just exposed to so much more virus, there’s a higher chance that you can get infected, whether you’re vaccinated or not, she said. Of course, vaccination is one of the best barriers, but it’s not a 100 percent barrier against getting infected. 

Though still uncommon, breakthrough infections with the Delta variant may impact public health. In an analysis of a recent outbreak in Provincetown, MA, that caused over 450 infections in the state, the CDC reported that the viral load was indistinguishable between breakthrough infections and cases in unvaccinated individuals. 

This was of course what sparked the CDC’s recommendation that everyone, including vaccinated people, mask up indoors, since the data would suggest that breakthrough infections can potentially transmit the virus, said Roan.","['breakthrough', 'percent', 'variant', 'remain', 'provincetown', 'guess', 'uncommon', 'viral', 'equat', 'recent', 'hospit', 'cours', 'delta', 'analysi', 'load', 'would', 'fail', 'ucsf', 'roan', 'sinc', 'mount', 'said', 'unvaccin', 'cdc', 'effect', 'vaccin', 'indistinguish', 'infect', 'barrier', 'somewhat']"
601,601,Do the breakthrough infections mean the Delta variant is better at evading the vaccines? How does it do that?,"Compared to the original virus, all the variants thus far are somewhat better at evading the immune system’s antibody response, some better than others, said Roan. That’s because so-called neutralizing antibodies recognize and bind to the spike proteins on the surface of the virus, preventing the virus from infecting cells. But if the virus mutates its spike protein, then the antibodies may not bind as well, and the virus gains an advantage. Fortunately, the antibody response is only part of the story, said Roan, whose lab studies another part of our immune response known as the T cell response. She and others have found evidence that our T cell response is less affected by variants. 

T cells work differently, she explains. T cells don’t target the virus directly, but instead recognize infected cells and destroy them, stopping the virus from replicating inside them. The recognition can also activate helper T cells which aid the responses of other immune cells. An infected cell signals to a T cell by presenting little pieces of viral protein on its surface. 

The reason the T cells are more resistant to the mutational effect is because each person generally presents a different little piece of the virus to their T cells, said Roan. So a mutation would for the most part only affect someone whose cells present that particular piece of the virus. When the virus is transmitted to another person, that mutational advantage is lost, unlike the antibody case where neutralizing antibodies from different individuals often target the same locations in the spike protein. 

In other words, when the virus mutates, the antibodies are less able to do what they’re supposed to do, but T cells are more resistant to the mutation effects, said Roan. ","['affect', 'surfac', 'variant', 'le', 'evad', 'bind', 'immun', 'cell', 'piec', 'spike', 'target', 'recogn', 'anoth', 'advantag', 'littl', 'roan', 'present', 'protein', 'said', 'better', 'part', 'differ', 'mutat', 'viru', 'neutral', 'resist', 'antibodi', 'infect', 'whose', 'respons']"
602,602,How important is our T cell response to fighting the Delta variant?,"Roan’s lab is currently preparing to study the Delta variant, and she is optimistic that the T cell response will hold up. They have already shown that the T cell response is just as strong against the Alpha, Beta, and Gamma variants as it is against the original virus. 

Roan’s team has also found that T cells may be particularly important in preventing severe COVID-19 infections. In a study of patients who were in the ICU for COVID-19, those who recovered showed a massive increase in T cell response right before they were discharged from the hospital, while those who died never developed a robust T cell response. 

T cells are probably less important for preventing that initial infection that’s where the neutralizing antibodies come in, said Roan. But then the T cells play an important role in making sure a person who has already been infected, recovers. 

For the unvaccinated, the Delta variant presents a serious threat, and now more than ever it is crucial to get vaccinated. It’s definitely going to be a lot riskier, said Roan. Right now, as many folks have said, this is a pandemic of the unvaccinated in this country. More than 97 percent of those currently hospitalized with severe COVID-19 are unvaccinated. 

The faster we can get more people vaccinated, the faster we can recover from the current surges, minimize deaths, and avoid straining the medical system, said Roan. While breakthrough infections are more of a concern with the Delta variant, those infections are generally mild or asymptomatic. The good news is that the vaccines were designed to protect against severe COVID, and they’re still doing their job, said Roan. 

For people who are fully vaccinated, Roan sees two main purposes to returning to masking indoors. First, because fully vaccinated people can still carry high viral loads and transmit the virus, masking protects those who are not vaccinated, including children under 12, and vaccinated individuals who may mount weaker responses to the vaccine, such as immunocompromised individuals. The second reason is that we still don’t know the risk of long-haul COVID-19 following breakthrough infections. That’s all unknown right now, said Roan, So I think it’s smart to put on a mask. 

COVID-19 has dominated our lives for over a year. The recent development of the COVID-19 vaccines has given us hope of returning to a normal life, but this tricky virus has also been adapting. Though we have seen many new mutations of the original virus, the Delta Variant has been making top news and leaving us with a number of pressing questions. We asked the American Lung Association’s Chief Medical Officer, Dr. Albert Rizzo, to speak with us about this important topic.

603,603,"Can you explain what variants are, particularly the Delta variant?","The coronavirus tends to have a high mutation rate and that is why we keep seeing a changing genomic signal of the virus in the population. The genomic signal is what the CDC monitors and these tests are done throughout the country to monitor the variant that is most prevalent. 

The CDC tracks multiple variants circulating in the United States and provides an estimate of how common they are at the national and regional levels. This data can change over time as more information becomes available. 

There are hundreds of mutations if not more. The variants of interest or concern per the CDC were named, originally by their site where first identified such as the U.K. variant, the Brazil variant and so on. Now names are given in order of discovery using the Greek alphabet so alpha, then beta and so on. There is also a coding system used to identify each variantB.1.1.7 is known as the Alpha variant. 

The Delta variant is currently of most concern. However, the latest variant to be highlighted by the World Health Organization is called Lambda, and now been found in at least 27 different countries. It is not yet listed as a ‘variant of concern’, rather a ‘variant of interest’ by the WHO, meaning it has been identified as causing transmission or detected in multiple countries.

604,604,Where did the Delta variant come from and how far has it spread?,"Delta, also known as B.1.617.2, was first identified in India during a ferocious wave of infections there in April and May. Delta is currently on the rise in the United States, particularly in the Midwest and Southeast. The CDC declared it a variant of concern on June 15, 2021. Delta is spreading fast. Using a rapid genotyping test, companies have found that the proportion of cases caused by Alpha fell from more than 70% in late April to around 42% as of mid-June, with the rise of Delta driving much of that shift. Delta seems to be around 60% more transmissible than the already highly infectious Alpha variant identified in the United Kingdom in late 2020.","['india', 'variant', 'unit', 'kingdom', 'june', 'drive', 'rise', 'midwest', 'mid', 'shift', 'spread', 'seem', 'wave', 'delta', 'april', 'highli', 'genotyp', 'fast', 'rapid', 'far', 'fell', 'identifi', 'southeast', 'around', 'feroci', 'declar', 'late', 'proport', 'compani', 'alpha']"
605,605,How can you tell if you have the Delta variant? Are there additional symptoms?,"Some reports suggest that the Delta strain could cause different symptoms than other variants. A U.K. study, for example, reported a change in the top-ranked symptoms since Delta starting dominating. 

Cold-like symptoms, including headache, runny nose and a sore throat, now top the list in that study, while more traditional COVID-19 symptoms  loss of smell, shortness of breath, fever and persistent cough  have since moved down. Doctors in the U.S. are noting a similar trend, especially in areas that have some of the highest rates of Delta cases. Regular COVID-19 tests do not detect which variant is involved in a patient’s casethat information does not change the approach to care or therapy. The variant identification requires genomic sequencing, a process separate from regular virus tests and one that not all labs are able to do or do not do on a routine basis for patient care but are done more for public health monitoring.

606,606,Is the Delta variant more deadly? ,While an increase in infections alone is troubling and can lead to more deathsboth through the increase in cases and by overwhelming the health systemearly research suggests Delta is possibly more dangerous than the Alpha variant and twice as likely to lead to hospitalization. ,"['aadhaar', 'variant', 'like', 'possibl', 'systemearli', 'case', 'abattoir', 'aarogya', 'abhishek', 'hospit', 'abnorm', 'deadli', 'delta', 'increas', 'danger', 'abid', 'twice', 'troubl', 'overwhelm', 'research', 'health', 'abdomin', 'suggest', 'deathsboth', 'abil', 'abl', 'lead', 'alon', 'infect', 'alpha']"
607,607,Is the vaccine effective against the Delta variant? ,"Yes. All of the vaccines available in this country have been shown to be highly effective against all current variants meaning that the vaccine reduces the chances of getting a severe illness, being hospitalized or dying from COVID-19. However, Delta is moderately resistant to vaccines in people who have received just a single dose of the Pfizer or the Moderna vaccine. So, the message is that the vaccines, in individuals who are fully vaccinated, are effective against the Delta variant.

608,608,Do masks protect against the Delta variant? What other things can be done to protect against it? ,"Because of what we know about the way coronavirus spreads, masks help protect against infection by decreasing the ability to inhale the droplets. So yes, mask do protect against the Delta variant. All other measures that we have used to date to mitigate spread of the virus which includes the hand washing and social distancing, and most importantly getting vaccinated, are the best ways to protect against getting COVID-19 whether it is from the Delta variant or any other variant.

For this reason, a decision about mask wearing should take into account some additional factors. The CDC says that vaccinated people do not need to wear masks when in public and can resume pre-pandemic activities unless other local regulations or restrictions are in place. But, depending on your comfort level and your underlying health status, you may still consider wearing a mask if you are potentially around a lot of people who may be unvaccinated, especially in a crowded space, to decrease that risk of low-grade infection. You should also consider wearing a mask if you are in an area of the country where surges, possibly due to the Delta variant are occurring.

609,609,Is there anything else you think the public needs to know? ,"The dominance of this variant in the U.S. now coupled with the loosening of social distancing restrictions means we are seeing surges of COVID-19 cases, hospitalizations and deaths in areas of the country where vaccination rates are low.

In its latest risk assessment for SARS-C0V-2 variants, Public Health England (PHE) has said a staggering 61% of the samples sequenced are now of the Delta variant (B.1.617.2).

611,611,What is the Delta variant of Covid-19?,"Multiple SARS-CoV-2 variants are circulating globally. One of these is the B.1.617 lineage, detected in India earlier this year. Early evidence suggests that its sub-lineage B.1.617.2, known as the Delta variant, is more transmissible than contemporary lineages. 

The World Health Organizaton (WHO), which has given it the label Delta, has categorised it as a variant of concern (VOC). It has said it continues to observe significantly increased transmissibility and a growing number of countries reporting outbreaks associated with this variant. 

WHO classifies a variant as a VOC when it is associated with an increase in transmissibility or detrimental change in Covid-19 epidemiology; increase in virulence; or decrease in the effectiveness of public health measures or available diagnostics, vaccines, therapeutics.

612,612,What makes the Delta variant a VOC?,"Different variants are characterised by mutations  or alterations in the virus’s genetic material. An RNA virus, such as SARS-CoV-2, is made of about 30,000 base pairs of amino acids, placed like bricks next to each other. 

An alteration in any of these base cause a mutation, effectively changing the shape and behaviour of the virus. The Delta variant contains multiple mutations in the spike protein. At least four mutations are important. One of these is called L452R, first reported in Denmark in March last year. This mutation has been found more transmissible than wild-type strains and also been associated with reduced antibody efficacy and reduced neutralisation by vaccine sera. 

The mutation P681R has been associated with chemical processes that may enhance transmissibility, PHE says. The D614G mutation was first documented in the US early in the pandemic, having initially circulated in Europe. There is evidence that variants with this mutation spread more quickly, the Centers for Disease Prevention and Control (CDC) says. 

Another mutation in Delta is T478K. This was present in around 65% of occurrences in variant B.1.1.222, first detected in Mexico last year and associated with higher infectivity.","['alter', 'occurr', 'year', 'variant', 'pair', 'brick', 'last', 'behaviour', 'shape', 'chemic', 'reduc', 'europ', 'transmiss', 'voc', 'characteris', 'delta', 'serum', 'wild', 'base', 'associ', 'neutralis', 'first', 'mutat', 'denmark', 'viru', 'amino', 'say', 'mexico', 'acid', 'rna']"

On Friday, a paper in The Lancet said adults fully vaccinated with the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine are likely to have more than five times lower levels of neutralising antibodies against the Delta variant than against other variants. In the longer term, we note that both increased age and time since the second dose of BNT162b2 significantly correlate with decreased NAb activity against B.1.617.2 and B.1.351both of which are also characteristic of the population in the UK at highest risk of severe Covid-19 , the study states.

It has been detected in several countries, including the United Kingdom, the United States and India. 

Last month, experts in India labeled the variant one of concern and warned that it appeared to be more transmissible than most. Citing studies, the country’s health ministry said that the variant has the ability to bind more easily to lung cells and could be resistant to therapies used to treat the infection.

However, Melita Vujnovic, World Health Organization representative to Russia, said last month that face coverings and vaccinations will be needed to fight the latest variant. 

Last month, German Chancellor Angela Merkel warned that Europe was still on thin ice and expressed caution that authorities across the continent should remain cautiously optimistic. 

We must remain watchful, new variants in particular, notably the delta variant, mean we must be cautious, she said during her last government statement. In the United Kingdom, where more than 72 percent of adults have been fully vaccinated, the delta variant has accounted for nearly all new infections, even though coronavirus cases overall are on the decline.

It accounts for more than 80% of newly diagnosed cases in the US, according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. 

COVID-19 cases have increased over 300% nationally from June 19 to July 23, 2021, along with parallel increases in hospitalizations and deaths driven by the highly transmissible B.1.617.2 (Delta) variant, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said in a Health Alert Network advisory this week.

620,620,Is the Delta variant is more transmissible?,"How much more is not really clear. Estimates range from 60% more to more than 200% more, depending on who is doing the estimates. One CDC document indicates the Delta variant is about as transmissible as chickenpox -- with each infected person infecting as many as eight or nine others, on average. The original strain of coronavirus, the CDC indicated was about as contagious as the common cold, with each infected person infecting two others. 

It's a difficult number to check, because figuring that out would require much more testing than is being done now. People who test positive would have to submit samples for genomic sequencing, and that's only done in a few places in the US. And to compare its transmissibility to past variants would require that kind of testing to have been done in past months -- and that simply was not done.

So everything relies on estimates. British infectious disease modelers, a group known as the Scientific Pandemic Influenza Group on Modelling, Operational sub-group, say the data indicate the Delta is 40-60% more transmissible than the B.1.1.7 or Alpha variant, which was once the dominant strain in the US but which has been replaced by Delta.

So while people may be more likely to become infected in the first place with Delta if they are unvaccinated, there's no hard data yet showing that Delta causes more serious disease. The CDC cites three older studies, from Canada, Singapore and Scotland, indicating people infected with Delta end up in the hospital more often.

What is also happening is that younger people are making up a larger share of those getting sick. More than 80% of Americans over 65 are fully vaccinated, according to the CDC. But younger Americans are not vaccinated at the same rate, so they're the ones showing up in ERs.","['diseas', 'cite', 'accord', 'offici', 'cnn', 'like', 'caus', 'younger', 'american', 'singapor', 'varaint', 'er', 'peopl', 'look', 'hospit', 'delta', 'canada', 'intens', 'sicker', 'hard', 'seriou', 'end', 'spoken', 'make', 'larger', 'fill', 'unvaccin', 'cdc', 'show', 'scotland']"
622,622,Can Delta variant infect fully vaccinated people?,"No vaccine is 100% effective, and many thousands of people who are fully vaccinated have nonetheless become infected -- something known as a breakthrough case.
The CDC released a startling study Friday looking at an outbreak in Provincetown, Massachusetts where 74% of people who got infected had been fully vaccinated -- and four of them ended up in the hospital.

The outbreak involved 469 people who caught Covid earlier this month. Testing identified the Delta variant in 90% of specimens from 133 patients, the researchers from the CDC and local health departments wrote in the CDC's weekly report. It's the first big study to contradict earlier evidence that vaccinated people are almost completely safe from serious disease, even involving Delta and other variants.

This was noted in a CDC presentation made to Walensky this week. Vaccines prevent more than 90% of severe disease, but may be less effective at preventing infection or transmission, it reads. Therefore, more breakthrough and more community spread despite vaccination. The CDC now notes this on its website.

Available evidence suggests the currently authorized mRNA COVID-19 vaccines (Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna) are highly effective against hospitalization and death for a variety of strains, including Alpha (B.1.1.7), Beta (B.1.351), Gamma (P.1), and Delta (B.1.617.2), the CDC says.

Data suggest lower effectiveness against confirmed infection and symptomatic disease caused by the Beta, Gamma, and Delta variants compared with the ancestral strain and Alpha variant. Ongoing monitoring of vaccine effectiveness against variants is needed, the CDC adds.

Tests done in lab dishes had indicated the immune response generated by vaccines should be, in theory, strong and broad enough to cover.

623,623,Will it be more infectious in breakthrough cases than past strains?,"While the CDC originally told people that the vaccinated are less likely to infect others, CDC's Walensky said this week the Delta variant may be different. The Provincetown study released Friday shows that. Persons with COVID-19 reported attending densely packed indoor and outdoor events at venues that included bars, restaurants, guest houses, and rental homes, the researchers wrote.

Tests on the infected people showed the fully vaccinated had as much virus in their bodies as unvaccinated people did. High viral loads suggest an increased risk of transmission and raised concern that, unlike with other variants, vaccinated people infected with Delta can transmit the virus. This finding is concerning and was a pivotal discovery leading to CDC's updated mask recommendation, Walensky said in a statement.

Because of this and other evidence, the CDC now says even vaccinated people should wear masks in areas of sustained or high transmission. It's because vaccinated people may get exposed and then may have enough virus growing in their bodies to infect someone else, even if they don't have symptoms. 


Findings from this investigation suggest that even jurisdictions without substantial or high COVID-19 transmission might consider expanding prevention strategies, including masking in indoor public settings regardless of vaccination status, given the potential risk of infection during attendance at large public gatherings that include travelers from many areas with differing levels of transmission, the team reporting on the Provincetown outbreak wrote.

A lot of what is known comes from one study done by researchers in China. They found viral loads of people infected with Delta were 1,000 times higher than people infected at the very beginning of the pandemic. Jing Lu of the Guangdong Provincial Center for Disease Control and Prevention and colleagues also said the virus transmitted more quickly -- in four days, compared to six days at the beginning of the pandemic. 

People who make back-of-the-envelope statements about Delta's properties are often referring to this single study. For instance, New York University infectious disease specialist Dr. Celine Gounder created a stir when she said people could be infected by Delta in just one second of exposure, compared to 15 minutes at the beginning of the pandemic. This wasn't based on scientific observations. Gounder was extrapolating from Lu's study, she explained on Twitter.","['infecti', 'even', 'begin', 'mask', 'pandem', 'provincetown', 'indoor', 'transmiss', 'wrote', 'peopl', 'find', 'viral', 'delta', 'load', 'transmit', 'statement', 'compar', 'said', 'walenski', 'gounder', 'bodi', 'cdc', 'studi', 'viru', 'vaccin', 'attend', 'show', 'high', 'lu', 'infect']"
624,624,What are the unique mutations? ,"The Delta strain has a constellation of mutations that mark it. Each variant carries a cluster of different mutations. When these mutations start to make a particular lineage of virus behave differently or have different effects, it gets tagged as a variant of concern or a variant of interest.

Delta has at least three mutations on a structure that is called the receptor binding domain -- the part of the virus that directly docks into the human cells it infects. They may help it escape detection by the immune system and at least one of them may help it bind more tightly to cells.
 
Another mutation in a place known as the furin cleavage site -- it's on the characteristic spike protein -- might also help make the virus infect cells more easily, according to the American Society of Microbiology.

The mutation is thought to increase viral infectivity and transmissibility; however, research indicates that it must occur on the background of additional spike protein mutations in order to be consequential, the ASM says.

It doesn't have some of the mutations that made other variants more transmissible, including one called N501Y that characterizes the Alpha or B.1.1.7 variant; the Beta or B.1.351 variant; and the Gamma or P1 variant. It also lacks a mutation called E484K seen in Beta and Gamma.

The answer to the spread, infectious disease experts universally say, is more vaccination. If we have more and more people vaccinated, we will win in this race, Walensky said this week.

Every time we turn around, there’s a new COVID-19 variant at the door. And with each one’s arrival, more panic seems to set in. While it’s natural to fear the unknown, it’s also good to know that the scientific community is monitoring all variants of COVID-19 in the United States and globally. Infectious disease specialist Kristin Englund, MD, shares some insights about variant AY.4.2, also known as Delta Plus, and reminds us why we still need to be careful as we roll into the indoor months.

625,625,Should we be worried about virus mutations or are they pretty normal?,"Mutations that occur when a virus makes copies of itself are quite common.

627,627,How is AY.4.2 different from the original delta variant? ,"The AY.4.2 variant has three mutations, with two of them being on the spike protein.

628,628,Should we be worried about vaccine resistance when it comes to mutations like delta plus?,"Mutations can cause vaccine resistance.

629,629,What can we do to protect ourselves from delta plus?,"As long as you are practicing the precautions already in place such as hand washing, masking, physical distancing and most importantly getting vaccinated, these appear to be as effective in preventing infection with AY.4.2 as with the delta variant.

630,630,What have we learned about the original delta variant?,"The delta variant is transmitted much easier than the first COVID-19 virus. It has hit younger populations (people in their 30s through 60s) much harder. Children and teenagers are being infected and many of these infections are resulting in ICU admissions and even death. We just topped 5 million deaths worldwide from COVID.

Other ways that the delta variant differs from earlier versions of COVID-19:
The delta variant is highly contagious. It’s more than twice as contagious as previous variants. It causes more severe illness in unvaccinated people as compared to other variants so far. It can be spread by fully vaccinated people however, they’ll spread it for less time as compared to unvaccinated people. Delta infections were detectable four days after exposure. The original strain could be detected around six days. Delta infections were also contagious for a longer period of time. The period was 18 days as compared to 13 for the original strain.","['icu', 'much', 'period', 'hit', 'variant', 'admiss', 'strain', 'origin', 'younger', 'spread', 'version', 'peopl', 'worldwid', 'death', 'delta', 'million', 'twice', 'six', 'day', 'teenag', 'compar', 'harder', 'time', 'contagi', 'four', 'unvaccin', 'detect', 'infect', 'top', 'easier']"
631,631,Why can’t we afford to ignore COVID-19 and more possible mutations as we head into winter and the holidays? ,"COVID-19 symptoms can be difficult to differentiate from flu symptoms. That’s why we must remain vigilant about flu-like illnesses and assume that they could be COVID-19. Also, as we head indoors more, the risk for transmitting COVID-19 increases","['aadhaar', 'assum', 'afford', 'remain', 'differenti', 'vigil', 'possibl', 'ill', 'like', 'symptom', 'indoor', 'risk', 'abattoir', 'aarogya', 'abhishek', 'difficult', 'increas', 'abid', 'holiday', 'transmit', 'also', 'winter', 'covid', 'abdomin', 'mutat', 'ignor', 'must', 'head', 'could', 'flu']"
632,632,What would you say to someone who is convinced that vaccines don’t work because of breakthrough COVID-19?,"Ninety percent of patients who have been admitted to hospitals have been unvaccinated.

633,633,Is the delta variant that contagious as well?,"The short answer is no, says evolutionary biologist and biostatistician Tom Wenseleers at the University of Leuven in Belgium. Yeah, I didn't find the CDC's 
statement entirely accurate, says Wenseleers, who was one of the first scientists to formally calculate the transmission advantage of the alpha and delta variants over the original versions of SARS-CoV-2. Nonetheless, delta is still highly transmissible, he adds. It's one of the most contagious respiratory viruses that we know of, he says.

Here's why. When scientists measure a virus's transmissibility, they often use what's known as R0, or R nought.  It's the number of people a sick person will infect when the entire population is vulnerable to the virus.

So it's the virus's potential of spreading, given ideal conditions for the virus, when no one has any immunity, says computational biologist Karthik Gangavarapu at the Scripps Research Institute.

For example, the flu has an R0 of about two. Each person infected with flu passes the virus on to two people on average. Some people will infect more than two people, and some will infect fewer. But over time, the average will be about two.

Chickenpox, on the other hand, is way more contagious, Gangavarapu says. Chickenpox has an R0 of about nine or 10. So each person with chickenpox infects about 10 other people on average. Outbreaks are explosive.

For SARS-CoV-2, the R0 has actually risen over the course of the pandemic as the virus evolved. When the coronavirus first emerged in 2019, SARS-CoV-2 was slightly more contagious than flu, Gangavarapu says. The initial COVID-19 strain had an R0 between two and three.

Then about a year later, the virus began to mutate quickly. The alpha variant emerged, likely in the U.K., and was more transmissible than the original strain. A few months later, the delta variant emerged, most likely in India. It was even more transmissible than alpha.

For the delta variant, the R0 is now calculated at between six and seven, Wenseleers says. So it's two- to three-times as contagious as the original version of SARS-CoV-2 (R0 = 2 to 3) but less contagious than the chickenpox (R0 = 9 to 10).

634,634,So why did the CDC say the delta variant was just as transmissible as the chickenpox?,"For one, the leaked document underestimated the R0 for chickenpox and overestimated the R0 for the delta variant. The R0 values for delta were preliminary and calculated from data taken from a rather small sample size, a federal official told NPR. The value for the table chickenpox (and other R0s in the slideshow) came from a graphic from The New York Times, which wasn't completely accurate.

At the end of the day, this delta variant is much more transmissible than the alpha variant, the official added. That's the message people need to take from this. The official requested anonymity because they were not authorized to speak to the media on this topic.","['request', 'tabl', 'variant', 'offici', 'leak', 'speak', 'underestim', 'calcul', 'accur', 'ad', 'transmiss', 'preliminari', 'came', 'delta', 'topic', 'graphic', 'medium', 'overestim', 'end', 'npr', 'valu', 'chickenpox', 'york', 'slideshow', 'size', 'feder', 'anonym', 'told', 'rather', 'messag']"
635,635,Where Did the Delta Variant Originate?,"The Delta variant, aka B.1.617.2, was originally detected in India in December 2020, according to the CDC. It's actually a mutation or sub-variant of B.1.617, the so-called double mutant strain that got plenty of attention in April 2020. As these viruses mutate and develop, they look like your family tree, John Sellick, DO, an infectious disease expert and professor of medicine at the University at Buffalo/SUNY, told Health. This particular sub-variant has wreaked havoc in India.","['infecti', 'doubl', 'india', 'variant', 'plenti', 'strain', 'havoc', 'medicin', 'origin', 'sellick', 'got', 'buffalo', 'look', 'delta', 'univers', 'april', 'wreak', 'john', 'actual', 'attent', 'suni', 'aka', 'sub', 'decemb', 'particular', 'tree', 'mutat', 'professor', 'mutant', 'told']"
636,636,What Was the Impact of the Delta Variant in the US?,"The Delta variant caused a lot of concern in 2021 in the US. According to the CD
C, the Delta variant was more easily transmissible than its predecessors. In a Yale Medicine report, F. Perry Wilson, MD, a Yale Medicine epidemiologist, said that Delta spread 50% faster than Alpha, which was 50% more contagious than the original strain of COVID-19. And while being vaccinated helped to lessen the degree to which you could become sick with Delta, you could still pass it on to others.","['becom', 'easili', 'md', 'predecessor', 'variant', 'accord', 'help', 'degre', 'strain', 'medicin', 'origin', 'impact', 'still', 'sick', 'lessen', 'delta', 'cd', 'faster', 'concern', 'wilson', 'said', 'lot', 'epidemiologist', 'report', 'contagi', 'yale', 'perri', 'could', 'alpha', 'pas']"
637,637,Why Was the Delta Variant so Concerning?,"The Delta variant has several mutations on the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2, which allowed it to spread more easily than previous forms of the virus. The CDC specifically said that this variant was more transmissible than previous variants, and that breakthrough infections were expected in vaccinated people. The CDC also said that vaccinated people who become infected with the Delta variant could pass it on to others, but that being vaccinated should help protect against serious illness, hospitalization, and death.

The CDC previously regarded the Delta variant as a variant of concern but changed that status to a variant of being monitored in the US on April 14, 2022, based on evidence of its significant reduction.

A variant like this can rapidly take over and become the primary strain circulating in that region, Stanley Weiss, MD, professor of medicine at the Rutgers New Jersey Medical School and professor of biostatistics and epidemiology at the Rutgers School of Public Health, told Health. That indicates that a variant has survival advantages. In places such as India where we've seen so many people infected and so much disease, there's evidence that this can spread quickly.

And take over it did. During the summer of 2021, Delta was showing up in 99% of COVID-19 cases in the US.

Experts were also concerned because the variant has the potential to at least partially evade the protection of the vaccine, William Schaffner, MD, an infectious disease specialist and professor at the Vanderbilt University School of Medicine, told Health. He compared Delta to B.1.351 (now called Beta), which was originally detected in South Africa. There is a chance that this can make you sick, even if you've been vaccinated, said Dr. Schaffner.","['becom', 'md', 'variant', 'medicin', 'take', 'spread', 'peopl', 'evid', 'delta', 'vanderbilt', 'stanley', 'advantag', 'partial', 'previou', 'summer', 'concern', 'said', 'schaffner', 'wei', 'health', 'rutger', 'jersey', 'cdc', 'biostatist', 'vaccin', 'william', 'professor', 'infect', 'told', 'school']"
638,638,What Are the Symptoms of the Delta Variant?,"Symptoms of the Delta variant are slightly different than those of the first variant that spread through the US. COVID is acting differently now. It's more like a bad cold; people might think they've just got some sort of seasonal cold, Tim Spector, professor of epidemiology at King's College London, explained in a video released on YouTube by the COVID Symptom Study.

Spector explained that the number one top symptom for those with the Delta variant is headache, and this is followed by sore throat, runny nose, and fever. Those are not the old, classic symptoms, said Spector. Number five is cough, [though] it's rarer. Spector added that loss of smell isn't among the top 10 reported symptoms for those with the Delta variant.

The CDC doesn't list separate symptoms for each variant, and instead, refers people to the typical symptoms of COVID-19. This may be because everyone's body reacts a little differently to COVID-19 infection. If you're experiencing COVID-19 symptoms and are unsure whether to get tested or seek medical care (like, is this just a cold or COVID-19), the CDC has an interactive Coronavirus Self-Checker that can help you make these decisions.","['colleg', 'variant', 'explain', 'spector', 'like', 'cold', 'symptom', 'got', 'checker', 'video', 'react', 'five', 'delta', 'king', 'number', 'unsur', 'youtub', 'london', 'rarer', 'old', 'covid', 'cdc', 'bad', 'season', 'tim', 'differ', 'slightli', 'classic', 'top', 'sort']"
639,639,Are Vaccines Effective Against the Delta Variant?,"Yes-ish. The CDC cited data from an unpublished study of COVID-19 cases in 44 counties in California, which found that COVID-19 variants with an L452R mutation, which Delta has, can cause a two-fold reduction in neutralizing titers in people who have been fully vaccinated against COVID-19. (Neutralizing titers help target and take out a virus, and they tend to correlate with the level of protection offered by a vaccine.)

The CDC said, COVID-19 vaccines are effective against the Delta variant and other variants with widespread circulation in the United States. But just how protective is left up to an individual's interpretation, since the CDC also stated that you could still get Delta and pass it on despite vaccination.

Even if this variant can partially evade protection of the vaccine, the more people who are vaccinated, the less apt this is to spread, said Dr. Schaffner.

The information in this story is accurate as of press time. However, as the situation surrounding COVID-19 continues to evolve, it's possible that some data have changed since publication. While Health is trying to keep our stories as up-to-date as possible, we also encourage readers to stay informed on news and recommendations for their own communities by using the CDC, WHO, and their local public health department as resources.","['cite', 'variant', 'despit', 'inform', 'unpublish', 'protect', 'titer', 'reader', 'delta', 'state', 'ish', 'sinc', 'california', 'said', 'schaffner', 'public', 'counti', 'covid', 'cdc', 'data', 'fold', 'neutral', 'vaccin', 'press', 'stori', 'correl', 'left', 'apt', 'surround', 'interpret']"
640,640,What exactly is the delta variant?,"The earliest documented COVID-19 case caused by the delta variant (B.1.617.2) was found in the Indian state of Maharashtra back in October 2020, and the variant has since spread widely throughout India and across the world. The World Health Organization (WHO) labeled it a variant of concern (VOC) on May 11.

So far, the WHO has identified four VOC: alpha (B.1.1.7), beta (B.1.351), gamma (P.1) and delta (B.1.617.2).

The delta variant has multiple mutations. Scientists don't know the exact function of these mutations at this point in time, but they are associated with allowing the virus to bind to the cells of humans and helping the virus to escape some immune responses, said Deepti Gurdasani, a clinical epidemiologist at Queen Mary University of London.","['back', 'deepti', 'variant', 'function', 'indian', 'point', 'earliest', 'exactli', 'bind', 'voc', 'throughout', 'queen', 'world', 'delta', 'beta', 'london', 'octob', 'multipl', 'document', 'epidemiologist', 'four', 'maharashtra', 'exact', 'gamma', 'mutat', 'viru', 'label', 'mari', 'gurdasani', 'escap']"
641,641,How widespread is the delta variant?,"The delta variant is spreading more and more globally and has been detected in more than 96 countries so far, according to the WHO. In the UK, more than 65,000 cases had been detected as of June 29, according to the global science initiative GISAID  the highest number of identified delta cases in a country so far.

It is important to note, however, that countries do not report their data to GISAID on a regular or daily basis. In addition, the amount of sequencing carried out differs from country to country. In other words, it is not always determined what variant of the virus caused an infection. This means that the number of unidentified delta cases could be very high.","['determin', 'unidentifi', 'regular', 'variant', 'accord', 'global', 'gisaid', 'june', 'case', 'widespread', 'note', 'delta', 'number', 'sequenc', 'scienc', 'mean', 'carri', 'uk', 'initi', 'amount', 'addit', 'word', 'far', 'alway', 'identifi', 'daili', 'detect', 'highest', 'countri', 'basi']"
642,642,What is the difference between the delta variant and the delta plus variant?,"Reports of a more infectious sublineage of the delta variant, sometimes referred to as delta plus or AY.1, have also emerged. This variant has the K417N mutation, which is commonly seen in the beta variant first identified in South Africa. There aren't too many cases of this variant at the moment, according to PANGO Lineages, a website created by scientists that allows users to assign Sars-CoV-2 sequences the most likely lineages.

This is a mutation that has possibly been associated again with better escape from vaccines and possibly even increased transmissibility, said Gurdasani. We don't yet know the properties of this new variant with this particular mutation on top.

643,643,Is the delta variant more infectious?,"The British epidemiologist Neil Ferguson believes that delta is about 60% more infectious than alpha, which was previously the predominant variant in the UK and, in its turn, is more easily passed on than the ancestral variant that caused the first pandemic wave of spring 2020.

The number of COVID-19 cases in the UK seems to back this up. From the start of June, the number of infections began climbing rapidly once more, and the country is now reporting some 15,000 or more new infections every day. This rise is going hand-in-hand with the increasing spread of the delta variant.

Data from Public Health England (PHE), an executive agency of the UK's department of health, indicates that more than 90% of new COVID-19 cases in the UK are from the delta variant.

PHE research found that the delta variant is associated with a 64% increased chance of household transmission compared to the alpha variant first identified in the UK.

What we noticed early on in India was that [the delta] variant was outcompeting or growing faster than the so-called Kent or alpha variant that first originated in the UK, said Gurdasani, and this was very concerning because we knew at that point in time that the alpha variant was already more transmissible than the original virus.","['phe', 'infecti', 'knew', 'variant', 'british', 'alpha', 'hand', 'climb', 'believ', 'origin', 'transmiss', 'ancestr', 'ferguson', 'delta', 'increas', 'number', 'england', 'execut', 'began', 'predomin', 'epidemiologist', 'first', 'kent', 'depart', 'gurdasani', 'spring', 'uk', 'new', 'outcompet', 'neil']"
644,644,Is delta variant deadlier?,"There is still little data available about whether the delta variant causes more deaths. What is known is that, according to the PHE, 117 of the 92,056 people infected with the delta variant in the UK up to June 21 died. That means a  fatality rate of 0.1%, which is very low in comparison with other variants.

However, experts believe that the low rate of deaths largely has to do with the fact that a large proportion of the UK population is now vaccinated against the coronavirus and does not mean that delta of itself causes any less serious cases of the disease.

Indeed, the hospitalization rate reported so far from the UK indicates that the variant causes a more severe course of illness rather than a milder one: The risk of ending up in hospital after becoming infected with delta is almost double that after being infected by the alpha variant, according to data from the PHE and a new study published in the medical journal The Lancet.

The data from the UK tells us that it is more likely to cause hospitalization, so it wouldn't be surprising if it is found to be more deadly, said Gurdasani.

While vaccinations in countries where these are widely available may avert some of this, that connection between case and hospitalizations is still not going to be lost, Gurdasani said, and we know that the majority of the world still has a large, unprotected population that hasn't been vaccinated yet.

More information is needed to confirm studies and reports that say the delta variant causes more severe disease, said the WHO's COVID technical lead Maria Van Kerkhove.

We need more information to determine: is it really the variant itself or is it a combination of factors? Van Kerkhove said.

645,645,"Do the vaccines protect us from the delta variant?
","A PHE study awaiting peer review found that the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine was 94% effective against hospitalization after one dose and 96% effective against hospitalization after two doses. AstraZeneca was 71% effective after one dose and 92% effective after two.

These vaccines thus do prevent hospitalization. For this reason, experts are not despairing about the fact that 50 people of the 117 who died from the delta variant in the UK up to June 21 had been fully vaccinated.

Germany's best-known virologist, Christian Drosten, spoke about this in an NDR podcast on the coronavirus. He said that although there were cases of death in people who had received two doses of vaccine, it should be considered what the real cause of death was and how the diagnosis was made.

The high proportion of vaccinated people among those who have died probably, like the above-mentioned low fatality rate, has to do with the fact that around half of the British population has been completely vaccinated. All of the 50 people who died were older than 50, according to the data.

Efficacy against symptomatic disease from the delta variant for Pfizer-BioNTech was 36% after one dose and 88% after two doses. For AstraZeneca it was 30% after one dose and 67% after two.

This doesn't mean that there is no protection, says Gurdasani. But there is definitely a reduced protection against just infection or asymptomatic mild disease, particularly with one dose, but also with two doses.

646,646,Is the delta variant responsible for the pandemic situations in India and the UK?,"Whether the delta variant is mainly responsible for the situation in India cannot be scientifically proven yet. More testing and sequencing would be needed for this.

But India is one of the countries worst affected by the pandemic. More than 30 million cases have been registered so far, according to Johns Hopkins University, and the health system is hugely overburdened. 

Clinical epidemiologist Gurdasani says that in addition to the spread of the mutation, several other factors have played a role in the massive spread of the coronavirus in India.

I think it's been a combination of very late action by governments to put basic public health measures in place and overconfidence that herd immunity had been reached prior to this, said Gurdasani.

In the UK, the situation has deteriorated drastically. The 7-day incidence rate for all COVID-19 infections was below 20 at the beginning of May but has since risen to more than 170 new infections per 100,000 people.

Traveling to so-called virus-variant areas should be avoided, as it has increased the spread of the coronavirus and its variants since the beginning of the pandemic. That is why comprehensive quarantine rules are needed, Gurdasani said.

The WHO's Van Kerkhove said on Twitter that public health and social measures need to be used strategically and must be supported by governments, communities and individuals to stop all variants of the virus.

648,648,What are the symptoms of the delta variant?,"According to data from the UK's ZOE COVID Symptom Study app, the symptoms caused by the delta variant differ from the ancestral virus and other mutations. As people in the UK with COVID-19 reported their symptoms to the ZOE app, they described headaches, sore throats, runny noses and fever. In some cases, there was coughing as well.","['aadhaar', 'variant', 'accord', 'sore', 'app', 'throat', 'caus', 'case', 'nose', 'symptom', 'ancestr', 'peopl', 'abattoir', 'aarogya', 'runni', 'delta', 'headach', 'cough', 'report', 'covid', 'studi', 'data', 'describ', 'mutat', 'differ', 'viru', 'uk', 'zoe', 'fever', 'well']"
649,649,Is the delta variant more transmissible?,"Most studies indicate delta is 50-60% more transmissible than the Alpha variant, says Dr. Bhramar Mukherjee, associate director for quantitative data sciences at the University of Michigan Rogel Cancer Center. The Alpha variant itself was nearly 50-60% more transmissible than the original strain.

This, according to Mukherjee, implies that if the reproduction number for the original strain was around 2.4-2.6, the one for Alpha is 3.6-4.2, and for delta, it is 5.6-6.7. In layman terms, if a person infected with the original strain could infect nearly two people, a person with the Alpha variant could infect four people. With delta, one person could infect nearly seven other people. It’s important to remember that these are averages, not absolute numbers; one delta carrier might infect zero people, or 25.

Its higher reproduction number is likely why entire families in crowded Indian cities like Delhi and Mumbai were infected together. It would also explain the tsunami-like surge of cases in the country in April and May.

The other consequence of a higher reproduction number (denoted as R in epidemiological data) in an epidemic is that it increases the threshold for herd immunity. That is, more people will need to have the antibodieseither through infection or vaccinationto be protected as a community against the delta variant. With an R of 2.5, the threshold for herd immunity is 60%, but with an R of 6, it is 83%, explains Mukherjee.

650,650,Do vaccines work against the delta variant?,"According to the CDC, studies show that the currently authorized vaccines which include Pfizer-BioNTech, Moderna, and Johnson&Johnson or Janssen work on the circulating variants.

Dr. Gautam Menon, professor at the departments of physics and biology at Ashoka University in India said, It is reasonably certain that the delta variant also exhibits some immune escape, although estimates vary as to the extent. For instance, single doses of Covid-19 vaccines, according to data from the UK, are only 33% efficacious against the disease.

But there is hope that those who are fully vaccinated are reasonably protected against serious disease. According to data from PHE, Pfizer’s mRNA vaccine is 96% effective, and the AstraZeneca vaccine 92% effective against hospitalizations after two doses. These, PHE says, are comparable to efficacy against the Alpha variant.

This also means that getting a large part of the population fully vaccinated is crucial for countries where the delta variant is prevalent. For countries like the US, where nearly half the population is fully vaccinated, scientists suspect a varied impact of the delta variant. I would expect some breakthrough infections and transmission happening even in highly vaccinated areas in the US, but would not expect a spike in hospitalizations and deaths, Mukherjee says.

We cannot be complacent with a large percentage only partially vaccinated, dropping masks and Covid-appropriate behaviors, she adds. We need full vaccination for a large fraction to fight the delta variant. She also expects that in pockets of the US with lower vaccine coverage, cases of delta variant could rise.

Experts from WHO reiterated that the delta variant is spreading rapidly among unvaccinated populations. However, the health agency quickly noted that vaccines are effective at preventing severe disease and death, including against the delta variants.

651,651,"Can masks keep the delta variant in check?
","Public health experts are investigating whether booster shots of vaccines will be needed to protect the population against the new variant.

Hence, the WHO is once again highlighting the need to wear masks. Vaccine alone won’t stop community transmission, said Mariangela Simao, the WHO’s assistant director-general for access to medicines and health products, during a briefing at the organization’s headquarters in Geneva. People need to continue to use masks consistently, be in ventilated spaces, [practice] hand hygiene, [maintain] physical distance, avoid crowding, she said.

Although Covid cases in the US have been steadily declining as vaccination rates are going up, it might be reaching an impasse. Joe Biden had set a target of immunizing 70% of adult Americans by July 4, but the country will fall short of it, reaching 67% of all eligible adults.

652,652,What is the delta plus variant?,"The delta variant has developed a new mutation of a type that was first found in the Beta variant. The new variantwhich is being labeled delta plus, though not officially by the WHO yetadditionally has the K417N mutation in its spike protein, which is associated with increased immunity escape.

Shahid Jameel, a top virologist in India, has said that delta plus could also render cocktail antibody treatmentslike the one given to former US president Donald Trumpineffective in fighting the disease. This variant could also potentially lead to vaccines being less effective. India has officially flagged delta plus a variant of concern, though after a great deal of indecision.

Menon says the delta plus variant is not a cause for worry yet but would be if it began to replace the existing variants. Currently, there is no evidence that this is the case, he says, so there is no cause for immediate worry, but this may change and we should be watchful for this.

Mukherjee warns that India, where 40% of the population is below the age of 17 and not eligible for vaccines, needs to adhere to strong public health interventions to control the coronavirus pandemic. Besides scaling up vaccinations, she suggests better studies around the variants, an area where India has been particularly slow. We need to study properties of these variants: what the clinical manifestations are, whether our diagnostic tests work well to detect them, whether treatments work well.

What is the delta variant?
","When Covid-19 infections broke out in Wuhan, China, that first strain was a wild type virus. This was the strain used by scientists across the world to develop testing kits, treatment plans, and even Covid vaccines.

It is in the nature of viruses to mutate, and it did. But not all mutations are serious, and usually do not require countries to reimagine their public health measures.

The variants of concernAlpha (first identified in the UK), Beta (South Africa), Gamma (Brazil), and Deltaare different from all other countless variants for this very reason.

The delta variant has certain significant mutations in the spike protein of the virusthe pointy elements that give it the shape of a crown (which is why it’s called the coronavirus). These spikes are like hooks that have to find the receptors in a human cell to link with. Studies have shown that these spikes hook onto receptors called ACE-2. Once these spike proteins can unlock the cells, the infection spreads by replicating the genetic code of the virus.

654,654,How is Delta Plus different?,"Each variant has a certain set of mutations. Delta, for example, has a set of mutations that make it excellent at infecting people, explained Dr. F. Perry Wilson, a Yale Medicine physician and researcher at Yale School of Medicine.

That’s why it’s so rapidly taking over, Wilson said. Because Delta is the dominant variant circulating, we’ll see it continue to mutate as it infects new people. Most of those mutations are not going to have significance, but there may be some that do, Adalja said. Delta Plus arose from Delta, probably in people who contracted an infection with the Delta variant. It shares almost all the same genetic code as the original Delta variant, but it contains some differences. One of its mutations. Trusted Source was also identified in the Beta variant, first detected in South Africa, according to Wilson. This mutation is thought to confer some resistanceTrusted Source to the monoclonal antibody treatments given to people with severe COVID-19. But those treatments aren’t a mainstay of the defense against COVID-19. 

According to Adalja, Delta Plus doesn’t appear to behave differently from Delta.
[I haven’t seen anything] definitive that the additional mutation that’s being tracked in Delta Plus has any major impact on how the virus behaves, Adalja told Healthline.
Delta Plus isn’t taking over, when a new variant emerges, scientists closely monitor it to see how it behaves differently and if it starts taking over. Any variant that has an advantage  i.e., if it’s more transmissible or can evade the vaccines  would likely start to take over, as the original Delta variant did. This, fortunately, doesn’t appear to be the case with Delta Plus, according to Wilson. Delta plus cases are not really taking over at all. They, over the past 6 weeks or so, been pretty stable, he said. According to Adalja, more information is needed to better understand if and how Delta Plus behaves differently. Delta Plus has been detected in the United States, but whether it’s able to outcompete the original Delta variant remains to be seen.

655,655,"Does it impact the vaccines?
","Whenever a new variant appears, the big question that follows is whether it will bypass the vaccines. The real concern is whether the variant can evade the immunity conferred by vaccination  and there’s no real evidence that Delta Plus can do that any better than Delta, Wilson said.

Adalja said some people think the vaccines will completely eliminate COVID-19  but that’s not the purpose of them. When it comes to Delta Plus, or any of the variants that we’ve seen thus far, the vaccines perform at what they were designed to do: stop serious disease, hospitalization, and death, Adalja said. Vaccines do a lot more than just trigger the production of neutralizing antibodies. They also confer immunity through T cells and memory B cells  which are known to be long lasting and effective at preventing severe illness, even with variants. As a result, it’s difficult for a variant to render the vaccines useless. That’s something that’s really hard for viruses to do in terms of mutations, Adalja said.

Why does a virus mutate?
","Virus by its very nature mutates. It is part of its evolution. The SARS-Cov-2 virus is a single-stranded RNA virus. So, changes in the genetic sequence of the RNA are mutations. The moment a virus enters its host cell or a susceptible body, it starts replicating. When the spread of infection increases, the rate of replication also increases. A virus that has got a mutation in it is known as a variant.

657,657,What is the impact of mutations?,"The normal process of mutations begins to impact us when it leads to changes in transmission levels or on treatment. Mutations can have positive, negative or neutral effects on human health. Negative impacts include clustering of infections, increased transmissibility, ability to escape immunity and infect someone who has prior immunity, neutralization escape from monoclonal antibodies, improved binding to lung cells and increased severity of infection. Positive impacts can be that the virus becomes non-viable.

658,658,Why are frequent mutations seen in SARS-CoV-2 virus? When will the mutations stop?,"SARS-CoV-2 can mutate due to the following reasons: Random error during replication of virus, Immune pressure faced by viruses after treatments such as convalescent plasma, vaccination or monoclonal antibodies (antibodies produced by a single clone of cells with identical antibody molecules), Uninterrupted transmission due to lack of COVID-appropriate behaviour. 

Here the virus finds excellent host to grow and becomes more fit and more transmissible. The virus will continue to mutate as long as the pandemic remains. This makes it all the more crucial to follow COVID appropriate behavior.

What are Variants of Interest (VoI) and Variants of Concern (VoC)?
","When the mutations happen if there is any previous association with any other similar variant which is felt to have an impact on public health then it becomes a Variant under Investigation.

Once genetic markers are identified which can have association with receptor binding domain or which have an implication on antibodies or neutralizing assays, we start calling them as Variants of Interest.

The moment we get evidence for increased transmission through field-site and clinical correlations, it becomes a Variant of Concern. Variants of concern are those that have one or more of the following characteristics: Increased transmissibility, Change in virulence/ disease presentation, Evading the diagnostics, drugs and vaccines.

Delta variant, also known as SARS-CoV-2 B.1.617, has about 15-17 mutations. It was first reported in October 2020. More than 60% of cases in Maharashtra in February 2021 pertained to delta variants.

It is the Indian scientists who identified the Delta Variant and submitted it to the global database. Delta variant is classified as a Variant of Concern and has now spread to 80 countries, as per WHO.

Delta variant (B.1.617) has three subtypes B1.617.1, B.1.617.2 and B.1.617.3, among which B.1.617.1 and B.1.617.3 have been classified as Variant of Interest, while B.1.617.2 (Delta Plus) has been classified as a Variant of Concern.

The Delta Plus variant has an additional mutation in comparison to Delta variant; this mutation has been named as the K417N mutation. ‘Plus’ means an additional mutation has happened to the Delta variant.

Research suggests that delta, officially known as B.1.617.2, is the most contagious of all the known variants to date, including the highly transmissible alpha variant that was first identified in Britain. Public health officials in the United Kingdom, where delta accounts for more than 95 percent of new Covid-19 cases, have said that the variant could be 40 to 60 percent more transmissible than the alpha variant, though studies are ongoing.

One of the ways epidemiologists determine the transmissibility of a new variant is to examine what’s known as the secondary attack rate. This involves tracking the close contacts of people who have been infected with different versions of the virus and seeing how many others tested positive.

Let’s say you have 10 people with 20 close contacts, said Dr. David Dowdy, an associate professor of epidemiology at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health. With one variant, maybe you see five of those close contacts get infected. If a second variant is 50 percent more transmissible, that number would be 50 percent higher. So in this case, you would expect 7.5 of those contacts to be infected, after accounting for vaccination status and whether they had a previous infection.

672,672,What is the delta plus variant?,"It’s not unusual for a virus to mutate and evolve as it spreads, and scientists have long cautioned that other worrisome variants could emerge with new outbreaks.

In India, researchers observed mutations separate from delta in a sublineage of the virus that they dubbed delta plus. While it has not yet been designated a variant of concern by the WHO or the CDC, cases involving delta plus have been reported in 11 countries, including the U.S. It's not yet clear, however, if delta plus carries additional risks or is associated with increased transmissibility.

673,673,Does the delta variant cause more severe illness or symptoms?,"More research is needed, but there are indications that the delta variant may cause more severe disease. A study published June 14 in the journal The Lancet examined the impact of the delta variant in Scotland, where it had become the dominant strain. The researchers found that the risk of hospitalization from Covid-19 was roughly doubled for patients infected with delta, compared with people infected with the alpha variant. 

If for comparison we look at the original strain, the U.K. [alpha] variant and now the delta one, we are noticing that there is a difference in transmissibility, as well as the potential for more dangerous outcomes, said Dr. Alejandro Perez-Trepichio, an internal medicine physician based in Naples, Florida.

Researchers in the U.K. have reported a shift in symptoms that may be associated with the delta variant. Data from an app that more than 4 million people in the U.K. downloaded to report symptoms, vaccination status and other demographic information daily found that the most common symptoms of Covid-19 are now headache, sore throat, runny nose and fever  similar to what people may experience with a bad cold. 

Some doctors in the U.S. have encountered a similar change. Shortness of breath, cough and other lung issues remain the most common symptoms of Covid-19, which was first identified in Wuhan, China, but some physicians have noticed more upper respiratory complaints, such as congestion, a runny nose and headaches, with recent infections. 

It’s not yet clear why cold-like symptoms are increasingly being reported, or if there is a link to the delta variant. The implications of such a change  if it exists  are also not yet known. A wide range of symptoms have been associated with the coronavirus, and the CDC includes congestion and runny nose on its list of potential Covid-19 symptoms.

674,674,Where is it spreading? ,"The delta variant has been reported in more than 95 countries, according to the World Health Organization. 

Every country that it has gone into up to now, you’ve seen an escalation in cases where it’s pushed aside the variant that was dominant before it, Fauci said Tuesday in an interview with NBC’s Nightly News. 

Cases involving delta have been confirmed in all 50 states in the U.S. and the variant is especially risky in parts of the country with low vaccination rates.

The variant is similarly fueling new outbreaks around the world. Several cities in Australia, including Sydney and Brisbane, imposed strict lockdowns to curb the virus’s spread. A stringent nationwide stay-at-home order was introduced in Bangladesh after infections spiked and the country recorded its highest single-day death toll of the pandemic to date.

In South Africa, a nightly curfew was upheld and new travel restrictions were put in place in Germany, Hong Kong and Taiwan to limit flights from areas where the delta variant is widespread.

675,675,Are vaccines effective against this variant?,"The vaccines in use appear to offer good protection against the delta variant, and most scientists agree that fully vaccinated individuals likely face little risk. Moderna announced Tuesday that its vaccine is effective against the delta variant. The results were based on blood samples from fully vaccinated people and showed that these individuals produced protective antibodies against several of the circulating variants, including delta.

Though detailed results have not been made public for all of the available shots, similarly promising results have been found with both the Pfizer-BioNTech and the AstraZeneca vaccines. An analysis released June 14 by Public Health England found that two doses of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine were 96 percent effective against hospitalization from the delta variant and two doses of the AstraZeneca vaccine were 92 percent effective. A previous analysis from the agency found that a single vaccine dose was less effective against symptomatic illness caused by the delta variant, compared to the alpha variant, highlighting the importance of getting both shots in a two-dose regimen. And with instances of so-called breakthrough infections, when a fully vaccinated person became infected, the cases have typically been mild.

In Israel, where nearly 60 percent of the population is fully vaccinated, a recent spike in Covid-19 cases associated with the delta variant  including infections among vaccinated individuals  was not also mirrored in an increase in hospitalizations. A South African study that tracked more than 360,000 health care workers vaccinated with the single-dose Johnson & Johnson vaccine found that 94 percent of breakthrough infections were mild. Though preliminary, the results suggest that the Johnson & Johnson vaccine offers good protection against delta and other variants of concern. The high-level message is that the vaccines work, two doses work better than one and the more people who get vaccinated the better, Dowdy said. 

Though there’s likely not much cause for worry among people who are fully vaccinated, public health officials are concerned about outbreaks in places with low vaccination rates. In the U.S., Covid-19 cases rose 10 percent this week over the previous seven days, an increase that was likely fueled by the spread of delta and lagging vaccinations, according to the CDC. Pockets of the Southeast and the Midwest, where vaccine uptake has fallen behind, remain especially vulnerable, according to health officials. This type of uneven vaccine landscape could result in local surges as the delta variant takes hold, Fauci said. That’s what we are concerned about, he said. We don’t want that to happen.

676,676,"Does everyone need to wear masks again?
","In response to the spread of the delta variant, the WHO advised that people, regardless of their vaccination status, should continue to wear masks. The CDC has meanwhile stood by its guidance that says fully vaccinated people can largely forgo masks, though the agency acknowledged that local rules may change based on the situation on the ground.

Earlier this week, Los Angeles County, one of the nation’s largest and the most populous, recommended that everyone, including people who are fully vaccinated, should wear masks indoors. 

Fauci said the CDC’s guidance on wearing masks likely won’t change unless new evidence emerges to warrant an update. If there are any changes that would instigate making a change in recommendation, that will happen, he said. But for now, the CDC recommendation stands that if in fact you are fully vaccinated, you are protected and you do not need to wear a mask outdoors or indoors. 

Fauci added, however, that some elderly people or individuals with underlying conditions may feel more comfortable wearing a mask in places that are experiencing an increase in infections. Ultimately, it comes down to comfort and common sense, Dowdy said. But he added that people should have confidence that the vaccines offer good protection. It makes sense to be cautious, but I worry that by saying everyone needs to wear masks again that we’re giving the message that we don’t think these vaccines are working, he said. That would not be a good message to send.

677,677,How infectious is the delta variant?,"Based on the data from the U.K., the delta variant is about 60%Trusted Source more transmissible than the alpha variant, which was previously called B.1.1.7. Alpha, in turn, is more transmissible than the strain previously dominant in the country.

Prof. Wendy Barclay, professor of virology and head of the Department of Infectious Disease at Imperial College London in the U.K., explained that this variant is more transmissible than previous ones because of some key mutations in the spike protein, which allows the virus to penetrate and infect healthy cells.

The delta variant has got two important mutations in its spike protein, or sets of mutations, she noted. One is at the furin cleavage siteTrusted Source, which we think is quite important for the fitness of the virus in the airway.

The virus that emerged in Wuhan was suboptimal in that respect, so it transmitted but perhaps not as well as it might. The alpha variant took one step towards improving that with a certain mutation, and the delta variant has built on that and taken a second step now, a bigger step, towards improving that feature, said Prof. Barclay.

678,678,"Are infection symptoms different?
","Data collected by U.K. scientists also indicate that the primary symptoms of infection with the delta variant of SARS-CoV-2 are different compared with those experienced upon infection with previous variants.

Thus, data from the ZOE Covid Symptom Study  whose scientific analysis is conducted by experts from King’s College London  suggest that the main symptoms of infection with the delta variant are headaches, a sore throat, and a runny nose.

This is a change from official information on COVID-19 symptoms  such as that provided by the U.K.’s National Health Service (NHS)  that lists fever, continuous cough, and loss of smell or taste as the main symptoms of the condition.

Prof. Tim Spector, co-founder of ZOE, warns that SARS-CoV-2 infections are acting differently now,  more like a bad cold, which may tempt people to dismiss the symptoms.

It might just feel like a bad cold or some funny ‘off’ feeling  but do stay at home and do get a test, he urges.

679,679,What are the risks going forward?,"Recently, a group of scientists called for the reintroduction of stricter safety measures in schools in the U.K. to curb the spread of the delta variant. Given the data on delta’s increased transmissibility, some scientists have suggested that this may increase the risk of a further COVID-19 wave.

Modeling projections from Imperial College London indicate that the delta variant may significantly increase the risk of hospitalizations with COVID-19, exposing the U.K. to the possibility of a third wave, similar to the one the country experienced last winter. Following concerning reports of the spread of this variant, the British government has already delayed the end of the pandemic restrictions in the country by 4 weeks.

Dr. Gottlieb also warned that the U.S. might experience further COVID-19 outbreaks because of this highly transmissible variant. I think in parts of the country where you have less vaccination, particularly in parts of the South, where you have some cities where vaccination rates are low, there’s a risk that you could see outbreaks with this new variant, he suggested.

For this reason, he encouraged people to get fully vaccinated against COVID-19, noting that the vaccines currently authorized in the U.S. appear to hold up well against the emerging variant. The mRNA vaccine [Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna] seems to be highly effective, two doses of that vaccine against this variant. The viral vector vaccines from [Johnson & Johnson] and AstraZeneca also appear to be effective, about 60% effective. The mRNA vaccines are about 88% effective. So we have the tools to control this and defeat it. We just need to use those tools, he commented.

As the SARS-CoV-2 virus continues to evolve, we explore what vaccine developers are doing to ensure their vaccines work against emerging variants and whether we need specifically adapted vaccines. To date, 12 COVID-19 vaccines have received authorization for use in at least one country, and many more vaccine candidates are undergoing clinical trials to test their safety and efficacy. Yet, like other viruses, SARS-CoV-2, the coronavirus that causes COVID-19, naturally undergoes mutations in time. These mutations can be negligible or affect how infectious or likely to cause severe disease a virus is.

680,680,Do vaccines work against variants?,"The answer to this question lies in the definition of the word work. When vaccine developers set out the conditions of their clinical trials, they work closely with regulatory authorities, such as the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), to ensure they answer the most important questions.

For most experimental COVID-19 vaccines, the primary endpoints, or the main questions that a clinical trial asks, were the prevention of COVID-19. This meant that the developers would assess any case of COVID-19, including mild and moderate cases, when they were calculating how well their vaccine candidate performed.

In the case of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine, which was the first to receive emergency use authorization from the FDA, eight people who had received the vaccine and 162 people who had received the placebo developed COVID-19. This equates to a vaccine efficacy of 95%.

681,681,Why do viruses mutate?,"Viruses are prone to mutations. Indeed, all genetic material, including that of humans, can mutate when mistakes occur during replication. A mutation of a virus occurs when there is a change in its genetic sequence. This creates variation and drives virus evolution. Mutations lead to changes in the proteins that are encoded in the viral genetic code. These changes can either be advantageous, harmful, or neutral.

682,682,"
How many mutations does it take to produce a new strain of the virus? 
","This is not easy to answer, in part because scientists disagree about the definition of the word strain. In general, if a virus has enough mutations to make its biology significantly different, it may be a considered new strain. This means that it may respond differently to vaccines or treatments, or it may infect a different species or transmit in a different way. But if the biology of the virus broadly remains the same, despite the mutations, the term variant may be more scientifically accurate. 

Since the start of the pandemic, there has been much discussion about SARS-CoV-2 mutations and what implications they may have. SARS-CoV-2, like many other coronaviruses, has an enzyme that proofreads its genetic code during replication, reducing the rate of mutations. While the novel coronavirus has a relatively stable genome, compared with other types of virus, it does mutate sometimes, and scientists have closely monitored these changes.

One of the most widely talked about mutations has resulted in the D614G variant. This causes a change in the spike protein, which interacts with the ACE2 receptor on human cells to facilitate viral entry. Specifically, an amino acid in the spike protein at position 614 is changed from aspartic acid to glycine. Research by Dr. Bette Korber, from the Los Alamos National Laboratory, in New Mexico, and colleagues suggests that this change allows the variant to infect people more easily. The D614G variant has become the predominant variant of SARS-CoV-2 worldwide, the research shows.

The team’s data indicate that people with the D614G variant of the virus may have higher levels of viral RNA than people with the original variant. But no evidence indicates that this causes more severe COVID-19. Still, not all scientists agree with this group’s interpretation. Referring to the paper, Dr. Nathan Grubaugh, from the Yale School of Public Health, in New Haven, CT, and colleagues commented that more research is needed to support the idea that this variant is indeed more transmissible. While researchers continue to study the differences between the D and G variants, the world has turned its focus toward B.1.1.7 and how it may shape the course of the pandemic.

683,683,"With increased travel restrictions and heightened lockdowns throughout much of the world, how likely is it that these variants will become dominant across wider areas?","New variants with enhanced growth properties are a concern to everyone. The near-simultaneous appearance of two variants of concern in the U.K. and South Africa suggests that such events can occur in any setting, Prof. Stoye told MNT. Short of total separation between different countries, spread will almost inevitably occur.

From past experience, it is likely that this new variant will travel widely around the world and is likely to become the dominant strain worldwide, Prof. Hibberd commented. This new variant is not likely to be the last and there will, no doubt, be further variants in the coming year or years.

Both experts stressed the importance of following public health guidelines, such as physical distancing, wearing face coverings, washing the hands frequently and thoroughly, and following all local lockdown rules.

684,684,"When a virus replicates inside the cell it has infected, the myriad of new copies will have small differences. Why is this important?","Genetic mutations are a natural, everyday phenomenon. They can occur every time genetic material is copied. When mutations lead to changes in how a virus behaves, it can have significant consequences. These do not necessarily have to be detrimental to the host, but in the case of vaccines or drugs that target specified viral proteins, mutations may weaken these interactions.

Since the emergence of SARS-CoV-2, several research studies have highlighted variations in the virus’s genetic sequence. This has prompted discussion about whether or not there are several strains, if this has an impact on how easily the virus can infect a host, and whether or not this affects how many more people are likely to die. Many scientists have called for caution. In this Special Feature, we summarize what researchers currently know about SARS-CoV-2 mutations and hear from experts about their views on what these mean for the pandemic.

685,685,Why are mutations significant?,"SARS-CoV-2 is an enveloped RNA virus, which means that its genetic material is encoded in single-stranded RNA. Inside a host cell, it makes its own replication machinery. RNA viruses have exceptionally high mutations rates because their replications enzymes are prone to errors when making new virus copies.

Virologist Prof. Jonathan Stoye, a senior group leader at the Francis Crick Institute in London in the United Kingdom, told Medical News Today what makes virus mutations significant. A mutation is a change in a genetic sequence, he said. The fact of a mutational change is not of primary importance, but the functional consequences are.

If a particular genetic alteration changes the target of a drug or antibody that acts against the virus, those viral particles with the mutation will outgrow the ones that do not have it. A change in a protein to allow virus entry into a cell that carries very low amounts of receptor protein could also provide a growth advantage for the virus, Prof. Stoye added.

686,686,What kind of evidence are skeptical scientists looking for in the debate around multiple SARS-CoV-2 strains?,"For virologists, ‘strain’ is rather a subjective word that does not always have a clear specific meaning, he commented. More useful in the SARS-CoV-2 situation would be the idea of ‘serotype,’ which is used to describe strains that can be distinguished by the human immune response  an immune response to one serotype will not usually protect against a different serotype. For SARS-CoV-2, there is no conclusive evidence that this has happened yet. To show that the virus has genetically changed sufficiently to create a different immune response, we would need to characterize the immune protection and show that it worked for one serotype and not for another, he continued.

Prof. Hibberd, who has been researching SARS-CoV-2 mutations, explained that scientists are studying neutralizing antibodies to help them define a serotype for SARS-CoV-2. These antibodies can prevent the virus from infecting a host cell, but they may not be effective against a new strain. Several groups around the world have identified a specific mutation in the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein, and they are concerned that this mutation might alter this type of binding, but we cannot be sure it does that at the moment. More likely, this mutation will likely affect the virus binding to its receptor, which might affect transmissibility.

We saw the CDC make the recommendation that people who live in areas of high transmission mask indoors.

Outbreaks have also been found in Mountain states, such as Wyoming.

In a preliminary analysis, two doses of the Pfizer or Moderna vaccine appeared to be about 88% effective against disease and 96% effective against hospitalization with the Delta variant, according to Public Health England. The AstraZeneca vaccine, which has not been authorized for use in the U.S., was about 60% effective against disease and 93% effective against hospitalization.

Johnson & Johnson has also reported efficacy from its one-shot vaccine against the Delta variant, which researchers estimate to be similar to the AstraZeneca results. However, a study released July 19 on a preprint server meaning it has not been peer reviewed found the Johnson & Johnson vaccine’s protection decreased significantly over time, hinting that people who get the J&J shot may need a booster shot.

The variant accounts for less than 1% of cases in the U.S.To a world that has become weary, yet accustomed to playing defense against SARS-CoV-2, evolution of the Delta variant is both unwelcome and unsurprising. Delta, or B.1.617.2, was first identified in India in Dec. 2020. Within a matter of months, this particular variant spread to over 98 countries around the world, becoming the dominant variant in more than a dozen of those countries, including India, the U.K., Israel and the United States. Delta is now responsible for more than 83% of COVID-19 cases being reported in the U.S. and, with only 48% of the total U.S. population fully vaccinated, conditions are ripe for continued evolution and spread of SARS-CoV-2. Three foundational questions continue to drive research with each new variant that’s identified.

Furthermore, significantly more viral particles have been found in the airways of patients infected with the Delta variant. A Chinese study reported that viral loads in Delta infections were ~1,000 times higher than those in infections caused by other variants. In response to this information, the World Health Organization (WHO) regards Delta as the fastest and fittest variant so far.

703,703,"Is the Delta Variant More Dangerous than Other Variants of Concern?
","According to surveys conducted in the U.K., where Delta accounts for ~90% of current COVID-19 cases, symptoms of Delta tend to be a little different than other strains, but that does not necessarily mean the associated symptoms are more severe. Fever, headache, sore throat and runny nose are common, while cough and loss of smell are not. Other reports link Delta to more serious symptoms, including hearing impairment, severe gastrointestinal issues and blood clots leading to tissue death and gangrene. Research is ongoing to determine if Delta infection is associated with increased hospitalization and death. One early study assessing the risk of hospital admission in Scotland reported that hospitalization is twice as likely in unvaccinated individuals with Delta than in unvaccinated individuals with Alpha.

Case numbers and hospitalizations are once again on the rise in the U.S., especially in states where vaccination percentages are low and the Delta variant is surging. On July 16, 2021, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) reported a 7-day average increase in new COVID-19 cases of 69.3% and a 35% increase in hospitalizations. Still, it is difficult to determine whether Delta is actually making people sicker than previous forms of the virus or if it is simply circulating amongst more vulnerable populations where case numbers are high, vaccination rates are low and increased stress on hospital systems is impacting patient care and disease outcomes.
What is clear is that the majority of hospitalizations and COVID-19-associated deaths in the U.S. are occurring in unvaccinated people, leading to a chilling warning from CDC director Dr. Rochelle Walensky that this is becoming a pandemic of the unvaccinated.

704,704,"Will Vaccines Remain Protective against the Delta Variant?
","Studies show that 2 doses of vaccines are effective at preventing hospitalization and death, but neutralization levels of vaccinated sera are lower against the Delta variant compared to the original strain. A study published in the New England Journal of Medicine tested neutralization activity of sera from individuals who had recovered from natural SARS-CoV-2 infection and sera from individuals who had been fully vaccinated with Moderna or Pfizer vaccines against infectious B.1.617.2 virus. Data from the study indicated that, on average, the Delta variant was 2.9 times less susceptible to neutralization than the Wuhan strain, but most convalescent serum samples and all vaccination serum samples showed detectable neutralization activity. As a result, researchers concluded that immunity conferred by mRNA vaccines is likely to be retained against the Delta variant.

These results were supported by research, published in Nature, that evaluated the sensitivity of infectious Delta virus against monoclonal antibodies, convalescent sera and sera developed after vaccination. The study found that some antibodies targeting the N-terminal domain and receptor binding domain of the spike protein (S protein) showed impaired binding and neutralization of the Delta variant. Additionally, convalescent sera, collected up to 12 months post-symptoms from individuals who had recovered from natural SAR-CoV-2 infection, were 4-fold less effective at neutralizing Delta than Alpha. Sera from individuals who were partially vaccinated (had received 1 dose of Pfizer or AstraZeneca vaccine) showed little to no neutralizing activity against Delta. Sera from 95% of those who received 2 doses of either vaccine generated a neutralizing response that was 3-5-fold less potent against Delta than Alpha.

Of these, 23 were in unvaccinated individuals, seven were in people who had received a first vaccine dose, and twelve occurred in fully-vaccinated individuals.

Experts are constantly monitoring new variants of the coronavirus that causes COVID-19 to see if they spread more easily, cause more severe disease, or could have an impact on the effectiveness of public health measures or vaccines.

The best way we can limit the transmission of COVID-19 is for people to get the vaccine when available to them and continue to follow existing advice on preventing the spread of the virus, including physical distancing, wearing masks, regular handwashing and keeping indoor areas well ventilated.

The vaccines protect most people from getting sick, but no vaccine is 100 per cent effective. A small number of vaccinated people may get infected with COVID-19; this is called breakthrough infection; however, the small number of vaccinated people who get infected with COVID-19, are likely to have milder symptoms. Therefore, if you live in an area with high-levels of COVID-19 transmission it's recommended to take additional precautions even if you are vaccinated.

The current wave of the omicron variant of the coronavirus making its way across the U.S.  dominated by the subvariants BA.4 and BA.5  is sparking new concerns about a seemingly endless cycle of Covid infections. Although there are still uncertainties about the different versions of the omicron variant, experts have a clearer understanding about it and how it affects people who are vaccinated or unvaccinated or who have previously had cases of Covid.

714,714,"What are the symptoms of omicron?
","For most people, at least those who are up to date on their Covid vaccinations, the original type of the omicron variant caused a milder illness that resembled the common cold, another form of the coronavirus. Anecdotally, doctors say, the symptoms of the BA.4 and BA.5 subvariants are mostly similar to those of the earlier version of the variant.

As far as we can tell, the BA.5 has not really proven too much different from the previous omicron waves, said Dr. Bernard Camins, the medical director for infection prevention for the Mount Sinai Health System in New York. We just know that it's more contagious. Dr. Roy Gulick, the chief of infectious diseases at Weill Cornell Medicine and and NewYork-Presbyterian, said typical symptoms of the omicron subvariants include: Sore throat, Hoarse voice, Cough, Fatigue, Nasal congestion, Runny nose, Headache, Muscle aches.

With the original version of the omicron variant, which swept across the U.S. at a dizzying speed last winter, the loss of taste and smell was not as common as with the earlier alpha and delta variants. However, with the spread of BA.4 and BA.5, that symptom seems to have returned, some doctors note. While the omicron variant may have appeared milder during the winter Covid wave, that could have been a reflection of the groups who were getting sick: the young and otherwise healthy, as well as those who were fully vaccinated. It is clear that if you’re vaccinated, particularly if you’ve had a booster, omicron tends to produce milder infections, Dr. William Schaffner, an infectious disease expert at the Vanderbilt University Medical Center in Nashville, Tennessee, said this year.

715,715,Does omicron cause less severe illness?,"There has been evidence that the omicron variant tends not to burrow deeply into the lungs as much as previous variants. A study, which was posted online by the University of Hong Kong and has not yet been peer-reviewed, found that while the omicron variant is less severe in the lungs, it can replicate faster higher up in the respiratory tract.

In that way, it may act more like bronchitis than pneumonia, said Dr. Hugh Cassiere, the director of critical care services for Sandra Atlas Bass Heart Hospital at North Shore University Hospital on Long Island, New York. Usually patients with acute bronchitis tend not to be short of breath. They tend to cough and produce sputum, he said. Patients with pneumonia tend to be short of breath and feel more fatigued than bronchitis in general.

A small study from the CDC found that people who had Covid and are later reinfected with the omicron variant may experience fewer symptoms than they did during their initial bouts with the virus. Still, it is virtually impossible for people to rely on symptoms to self-diagnose an illness. Doctors urge people who have any cold symptoms or flulike symptoms to get tested.

716,716,How quickly do omicron symptoms appear?,"The time it takes for an infected person to develop symptoms after an exposure is shorter for the omicron variant than for previous variants  from a full week down to as little as three days or less, according to the CDC. While much more research is needed, it makes scientific sense that a highly contagious virus like the omicron variant would have a shorter incubation period.

Its goal, after all, is to infect as many people as possible as quickly as possible. That's why the spread is occurring at a much faster pace, said Dr. Anita Gupta, an anesthesiologist and critical care physician at the Johns Hopkins School of Medicine. She added that it is possible the incubation period could be shorter or longer depending on a number of variables, including age, underlying health problems and vaccination status. There is no hard and fast rule here. A lot of these patients are not having the symptoms for the 10 to 12 days that I saw when there were no vaccinations, said Dr. Rahul Sharma, the emergency physician-in-chief at the NewYork-Presbyterian/Weill Cornell Medicine.

717,717,What is the duration of omicron symptoms?,"Sharma noted that, in general, symptoms appear to be shorter and milder in the vaccinated compared to the unvaccinated. For the vaccinated, emergency room or hospital stays are also typically shorter with the omicron variant. What I can tell you is that patients that are unvaccinated are definitely our sicker patients, Sharma said. Those are the patients that are more likely to go to the ICU. Those are the patients that are more likely to be admitted to the hospital. Dr. Ryan Maves, an infectious diseases and critical care physician at the Wake Forest School of Medicine in North Carolina, agreed, saying the overwhelming majority of Covid patients he sees in the intensive care unit are unvaccinated.

If you've been exposed and now you're asking yourself, 'When should I get tested?' I think you would best wait at least three days to see if you've turned positive, he said. If you have a known exposure to someone with Covid, the CDC recommends to get tested at least 5 days after exposure.

719,719,Could omicron lead to long Covid?,"Although much about the omicron variant remains unknown, some experts say it could lead to long Covid, even with mild cases. In a recent study, British researchers found that the omicron variant is less likely to cause long Covid symptoms than delta, although all of the 41,361 adult participants who regularly reported their Covid symptoms on a phone app had been vaccinated.

Patients with long-term symptoms can experience crushing fatigue, irregular heart rhythms and other issues months after their initial Covid infections. That occurred during the first wave of the pandemic, and it continued to lead to long Covid issues through the delta wave. Previous research suggests that vaccination can greatly reduce the risk for long Covid.

720,720,"
How worried should I be about omicron?","The BA.5 omicron subvariant accounted for nearly 54% of the country’s Covid cases as of July 2, according to the CDC. BA.4 accounts for 17% of sampled cases. Because the BA.5 subvariant is so much more transmissible, people should probably re-engage in some of the prevention strategies that we recommended earlier, Gulick said. So wearing masks indoors or wearing masks in crowded places is a reasonable thing to do. There is no data yet to suggest that BA.5 or other known omicron subvariants are more aggressive viruses than the other ones, Gulick said.

Because it is easier to catch than the other viruses, people really need to get vaccinated and boosted, he said. After the lethal Delta variant created havoc last year, another variant of Covid-19 surfaced in early November 2021, the highly transmissible Omicron. With several mutations and substrains, Omicron has become extremely prevalent and most cases in recent past have been associated with this variant. Omicron's sub-variants, BA.4 and BA.5 have been declared the most dominant in the United States and responsible for the fourth wave in many countries including India. And now another sub-variant of Omicron, BA.2.75 has been detected in India. According to an Israeli health expert, this new variant could be 'alarming' in nature as 10 states in India have detected Omicron BA.2.75.

Medical experts are of the opinion that this sudden spike in Covid-19 cases is due to the three new sub-variants of Omicron virus BA.2. Out of these three, the BA.2.75 variant needs to be monitored, experts said. It is seen that of late among all the Omicron cases which are now getting registered in the country, the virus is spreading 18% more than the other variants. Apart from the BA.2.75 sub-variant of Omicron, BA.2.74 and BA.2.76 are also believed to be responsible for the increase in Covid-19 cases. In the last 10 days, 298 cases of BA.2.76, 216 cases of BA.2.74 and 46 cases of BA.2.75 have been identified, TOI quoted an open source database. BA.2.75 sub-variant is also spreading in the United States, Canada and Japan. Back home, BA.2.75 cases have been reported in Maharashtra, Karnataka and Jammu and Kashmir. So far 10 states have reported BA.2.75 variants including Delhi.

721,721,"What is BA.2.75 and how is it different?
","BA.2.75 is a sub-lineage of the Omicron variant besides BA.4 and BA.5. Sub-lineages of Omicron have become the dominant variants circulating across the globe, with new mutations continuously evolving. Currently, it has been detected in about 10 states in India. The Indian Health Ministry and the Indian SARS-CoV-2 Genomics Consortium (INSACOG), a genomic surveillance organisation, are yet to officially announce or confirm the detection of the sub-variant in the country. While there is not much known about the new sublineage, health experts have raised concerns about the same. 

Experts say the BA.2.75 variant includes new mutations in the spike protein, in addition to the mutations that are already present in the Omicron variant. Of the mutations, G446S and R493Q are of particular concern, as it gives the variant the ability to evade several antibodies. This means it can infect people who have been vaccinated, or have been infected previously.

As of now, it seems that BA.2.75 will have antibody escape that is similar to that for BA.4/5 with respect to the current vaccine. Research reveals that the R493Q mutation increases the virus's ability to attach to ACE2, the protein which the Covid-19 virus uses to enter cells. There are four mutations in the receptor binding domain region, which interacts with the ACE2 receptor in the host. The ACE2 is an enzyme that acts as the receptor for the SARS-CoV-2 virus and allows it to infect host cells.

723,723,"What is Variant of Interest (VOI)?
","Variant of Interest (VOI) is a SARS-CoV-2 variant : 
With genetic changes that are predicted or known to affect virus characteristics such as transmissibility, disease severity, immune escape, diagnostic or therapeutic escape.
Identified to cause significant community transmission or multiple COVID-19 clusters, in multiple countries with increasing relative prevalence alongside an increasing number of cases over time, or other apparent epidemiological impacts to suggest an emerging risk to global public health. 
Current variants of interests are Lambda(designated on 14-Jun-2021) and Mu designated on 30-Aug-2021).

Current knowledge about Omicron:
Transmissibility: It is not yet clear whether Omicron is more transmissible. 
Severity of disease: It is not yet clear whether infection with Omicron causes more severe disease compared to infections with other variants, including Delta.
Effectiveness of prior SARS-CoV-2 infection: Preliminary evidence suggests there may be an increased risk of reinfection with Omicron (i.e, people who have previously had COVID-19 could become reinfected more easily with Omicron), as compared to other variants of concern, but the information is limited.
Effectiveness of vaccines: WHO is working with technical partners to understand the potential impact of this variant on our existing countermeasures, including vaccines.
Effectiveness of current tests: The widely used PCR tests continue to detect infection, including infection with Omicron, as we have seen with other variants as well.
Effectiveness of current treatments:   Corticosteroids and IL6 Receptor Blockers will still be effective for managing patients with severe COVID-19.

Recommended actions for countries by WHO:
Enhance surveillance and sequencing of cases. 
Share genome sequences on publicly available databases, such as GISAID.
Report initial cases or clusters to WHO.
Perform field investigations and laboratory assessments to better understand if Omicron has different transmission or disease characteristics, or impacts the effectiveness of vaccines, therapeutics, diagnostics or public health and social measures.
Increase some public health and medical capacities to manage an increase in cases.
Implement effective public health measures to reduce COVID-19 circulation overall, using risk analysis and a science-based approach.

724,724,Is Omicron a cause of concern?,"As we know, coronavirus mutates continuously. With every mutation, a new variant emerges. WHO classified these variants into two categories:
A variant of concern (VOC): It includes the Alpha, Beta, Gamma, and Delta variants of the coronavirus. A variant of interest (VOI): Under this category, World Health Organization placed the Eta, Iota, Kappa, and Lambda variants of coronavirus.
Variants classified under a variant of concern are rapidly transmissible from one person to another and with a higher fatality rate, and the overall effectiveness of the treatment is comparatively less. Omicron is the fifth variant of concern because it is mutating very rapidly. Till now, more than 30 mutations are being recognized in Omicron. The first patient of Omicron was detected in South Africa. In India, the first case of the Omicron variant was reported in Karnataka.

Long-term harmful effects of covaxin are rare. The most common reported side effect of covaxin is pain and soreness at the injection site. Some children may also suffer from mild fever. These symptoms may disappear on their own after 1-2 days. Against the common myth that Covaxin may cause infertility in children, there is no scientific proof regarding the correlation between the COVID vaccine and infertility in children or adults. Covaxin has not shown any fertility-related side effects till now. The covaxin is manufactured by following proper safety protocols and is tested rigorously before getting approved for usage for children. The vaccine has a dead virus, so it cannot give the infection to the recipient. It only strengthens immunity in children. Many children have a fear of needles that may even get worse with age.

Parents can become role models by demonstrating to their children that there is no pain while getting shots.
Accompanying comforting items during shots like a favorite book or audio music can distract your child and reduce their anxiety.
Parents should teach their children many coping methods to overcome fear, like deep breathing before and during getting shot and squeezing a ball or your hand.
Parents should also remain calm during vaccination. Children tend to get more nervous when they see their parents getting anxious about things.
Parents should try to avoid using any negative words on their children.
Instead of criticizing your child, reassure them that it’s ok to get frightened and you are right there for them. Reassuring your children can help them to cope with the situation.
It is also advisable for you to discuss your child’s fear of needles with medical staff before taking jabs so that they can also help in dealing with your child’s fear of the needle. 
Encouraging words like you did a good job may help your child a lot after vaccination.

The symptoms of the omicron variant are different from the classic coronavirus infection. Instead of classic symptoms like cough, cold, fever, and loss of taste and smell, the omicron symptoms are more like the common cold, such as runny nose, sneezing, and sore throat. According to some research, the omicron symptoms are milder in vaccinated than in non-vaccinated people. Since omicron emergence, numerous mutant strains come into existence. The omicron virus is more potent in mutation than other variants of the coronavirus. The virus is still evolving, and we can see the rise in COVID cases. Now, most of the COVID-19 cases are due to omicron subvariants, and all the subvariants come in variant of concern category. In India, the new sub-lineage omicron BA.2.75 has emerged, which has also been classified, as a variant of concern.

According to numerous researchers and healthcare professionals, vaccines and booster doses don’t prevent getting an infection, but they reduce the risk of severity and morbidity. Vaccination and corona infections cause a gradual increase in herd immunity worldwide.
Healthcare professionals suggest that vaccines (both the primary and booster dose) are the best defense against hazardous coronavirus infections. As we don’t have sufficient statistics against this latest subvariant, the healthcare providers suggest booster jabs, wearing the appropriate mask, sanitization, and social distancing. If you get the virus, isolate and quarantine yourself. We all want to return to our pre-pandemic routine, but with these continued mutations, we need to accept that living with these conditions with much alertness is the new normal.

These patients may have mild upper respiratory tract symptoms with or without fever.

In the wake of an alarming rise in the number of cases, the union health ministry issued revised guidelines for home isolation for an asymptomatic or mild infection. Some of the important excerpts from the guidelines are:
After reviewing the condition of the Covid positive patient by the treating medical officer, the patient may go for home isolation and self-quarantine. The patient and the caregiver will also get a COVID control room contact number to get information about subsequent tests, symptom management-related guidance, and emergency hospital bed requirements (if the symptoms get worsened).
Mild/asymptomatic patients should have the essential facility and be well ventilated in their room for self-isolation and the quarantine of the immediately contacted family members.
The government also recommends a presence of a fully vaccinated caretaker 24×7 to help the patient. The caretaker should always wear a mask, disposable gloves, and disposable gown and discard them immediately after exiting the patient’s room.
The patient should avoid contact with the family members except for the caretaker.
The time for home isolation of omicron-infected patients has been decreased to seven days from testing positive if they show no signs of fever for three days in a row, instead of ten days before.
Elderly patients above 60 years and patients with concomitant illnesses like hypertension, diabetes, heart disease, chronic lung disease, kidney disease, or cerebrovascular diseases shall only be allowed home isolation after a thorough evaluation by the treating medical practitioner.
It is also essential for the family members of the infected patient to strictly follow home quarantine rules.
The patient should wear at least tripled layer medical or preferably an N-95 mask. The caregiver should regularly monitor the patient’s body temperature and blood oxygen level (using a pulse oximeter). The patient should discard the mask after eight hours of use. The mask can be discarded earlier also if it becomes wet or is visibly soiled. One should always discard the mask after cutting it into pieces and putting it in a paper bag for at least 72 hours.
COVID patients should keep themselves hydrated by drinking plenty of water and fluid. The patient should also include immunity booster food in their diet. The patient should also follow proper sanitization instructions like frequent hand wash and keeping a safe distance from other family members.
There should be daily monitoring of patients in home isolation by the district administration.
There is no need for re-testing after ten days if the patient is exhibiting no symptoms.
If the patient is experiencing worsening symptoms or trouble breathing during home isolation, the caretaker should immediately contact the Covid contact room or go to the nearest hospital.

740,740,What are some ways to save your kids from Coronavirus? ,"The second wave of Coronavirus has been hard on us. The entire country is shaken and India’s healthcare infrastructure has been startled. The most vulnerable part of the society Children, are getting affected by the new mutations circulating in the country. It is important to educate about the virus and learn about the different ways we can prevent it. This will not only protect us but the future generation from the implications of the pandemic.

COVID-19 hit us for the first time in 2020. Back then only older adults and people with pre-existing chronic conditions were considered to be the most vulnerable. With the second wave hitting the peak, it is observed that even children, who were up until now considered only carriers, can be affected by the deadly virus.

With the rising number of COVID cases in children by day increasing day, it is quintessential to protect them and prevent the spread of the infection. By educating our children about the pandemic and encouraging them to take certain precautions, we can contain the negative impact of the virus efficiently and also keep our children safe from the same.

Here are 15 ways to keep your children safe from Coronavirus:
Encourage them to stay indoors
It is hard to keep children indoors all the time but you must encourage your child to stay indoors during this crisis period. Do not send your kids outdoors to play, organize fun indoor games and keep them engaged.

Maintain social distancing
During times like this, it is advised to avoid having visitors at home. It is important to stay vigilant and cautious. In case you have visitors, ensure your kids maintain social distancing. Do not leave your child unattended when you are outdoors and practice social distancing.

Maintain personal hygiene
Frequent washing of hands is the number one rule when it comes to the Coronavirus. Before touching your eyes, nose, and mouth, sanitizing is crucial. Children when left unattended may touch contaminated surfaces and objects, which may lead to an infection. To avoid that make sure your children wash their hands regularly with soap and water for 20 seconds. Alternatively, you can use a hand sanitizer that contains at least 60% alcohol. Teach your kids to properly wash covering all surfaces of their hands with hand sanitizer. If your child is too young supervise them when they use hand sanitizer.

Disinfect frequently touched surfaces and objects
While washing your hands is important, disinfecting frequently touched surfaces and objects is equally important too. Studies state that the virus can latch onto objects or surfaces. Therefore, when you or your children may come in contact with a contaminated surface you will get infected. To avoid this, disinfect surfaces as frequently as you can.

Wear a mask
Wear a mask and make sure everyone in your household also wears a mask when in public and when around people who don’t live in your household. Make sure your child wears their masks correctly and refrains from touching them.

Cover coughs and sneezes
Teach your kid to cover their mouth and nose with a tissue, throw the tissue in the dustbin and wash hands thoroughly while coughing or sneezing.

Teach good hand hygiene
Practicing good hygiene is critical. This includes not touching your eyes, mouth, or nose with unwashed hands and covering your mouth and nose when you sneeze. Make sure children wash their hands when they come home, after using the restroom, and before eating with soap and water for 20 seconds. Set a timer on by the sink as may help encourage your child to get through the process.

Remind them to avoid shaking hands
To curb the spread of Coronavirus, most places have banned the practice of handshaking. Since handshaking happens at schools among young children it is necessary to remind children to avoid this type of greeting.

Stock up on supplies
It is recommended for parents to stock up on a month’s worth of crucial items such as diapers, groceries, medicines, toiletries, etc. Families should also fill their medicine cabinets with prescription medications and medical supplies to avoid frequent visitations to stores.

Bags, supplies, and other shopping items at the door
At any point during the year, and especially now, parents should remember to leave bags, shoes, and items that they carried outside by the front door since they can carry in bacteria from the outside. Use them only after spraying disinfectant or keep them aside for a few hours.

Consider avoiding highly trafficked places
Coronavirus spreads through the air in tiny droplets produced when a sick person breathes, talks, coughs, or sneezes. The virus spreads most easily when people are within six feet of one another. Parents should avoid highly trafficked public spaces, like libraries and malls, in areas that have confirmed cases.

Clean your home, especially areas that get heavy use
It’s crucial for families to thoroughly clean high-use areas of the home to prevent the spread of the Coronavirus. The refrigerator door, staircase railings, tablets, phones, and toys are some of the most-touched places in the home. To get the maxim benefit, leave the surface wet for at least 15 to 30 seconds.

Help your child stay active
Regular physical activity is required for the child’s physical and mental health.
Make sure your child stays active every day while taking everyday preventive actions.
Find ways to make physical activity a part of your child’s life.
Be a role model to your child by setting a positive example. Lead an active lifestyle and make physical activity a part of your family’s daily routine.
Help your child stay socially connected
Connect your kid with friends and family via phone or video chats.
Encourage them to letters to family members.



Disconnect from the Internet
During tough times like this family, bonding is very important, especially for kids. Constantly reading updates about the health crisis can lead to heightened anxiety and panic. This may affect your mood which could also affect your child’s mood.

What are some common concerns about the covid-19 vaccine in cancer? 
","The second COVID-19 wave brought with it a lot of fear, anxiety, anger, frustration, and helplessness. Though we may have won this battle, the war is still on. In this war, we lost far too many. The pandemic made us realize how fragile we are and the importance of a self-reliant and developed health care system. The only way we can win this war is by using our common sense and trusting modern science. Having cancer increases your risk of severe illness from COVID-19. Other factors which can increase your risk for severe illness from COVID-19, include a weakened immune system, older age, and other medical conditions. People with blood cancers may be at higher risk of prolonged infection and death from COVID-19 than people with solid tumors. That is because these patients often have abnormal or depleted levels of immune cells that produce antibodies against viruses. Vaccination is the only hope to fight against Corona.

Other common side effects include fatigue, tiredness, muscle pain, chills, joint pain, and fever. These side effects are most commonly reported in younger vaccine recipients and following the second shot of the vaccine. Side effects typically resolve after one or two days. Speak with your healthcare provider before getting vaccinated. Your type of cancer and type of treatment will be a factor to be considered. Your healthcare provider will be able to discuss risks, benefits, timeline, and what you should know before receiving your first dose of the vaccine

744,744,Should cancer patients pre-medicate before the vaccine to reduce the vaccine-related side effects?,"Premedication is not generally advised. For patients with a history of allergy, premedication may mask early symptoms of life-threatening hypersensitivity reaction and is therefore not routinely recommended.Timing the vaccine and cancer treatment
If a vaccine is available to you, it may be appropriate to delay the start of some non-urgent cancer treatments until the vaccination is completed. Most cancer treatments, however, should not be delayed because of vaccination.

For patients receiving chemotherapy or other immune-suppressing therapy
In general, receiving either vaccine during chemotherapy is recommended. Because the vaccine can cause a fever within the first 24 to 48 hours, it’s preferable to receive the vaccines at a time when your white blood counts are not expected to be below. For patients receiving immunotherapy also, it’s fine to proceed with vaccination

For patients receiving radiotherapy
For most patients undergoing radiotherapy, it’s recommended to proceed with vaccination, and radiation treatment need not be interrupted.

For patients planning for cancer surgery
Since fever can occur in the first 24 to 48 hours after vaccination, its best to avoid scheduling your vaccination within a few days of planned surgery as fever may result in a delay in surgery

For patients who have undergone stem cell transplantation
Patients who are within three months of stem cell transplantation should discuss with their healthcare providers the timing of vaccination. In addition, those with severe acute graft versus host disease and those with low B cell counts should discuss with their health care provider whether vaccination should be delayed.

For patients who are on follow-up/post-completion of cancer treatment
It is recommended that you get a vaccination since there might be some lingering effects of cancer treatment in long term on your immune system and you might also make you susceptible to severe covid

For patients who have already had COVID-19
In general. It's recommended that you receive the COVID-19 vaccine even if you were already infected with a virus, although you may choose to wait three to six months after your illness

For family members of cancer patients 
It’s very important to get vaccinated since it creates a protective barrier or herd immunity and reduces the chances of infection for other members.

 
COVID AND CARDIOVASCULAR INVOLVEMENT
Since clusters of coronavirus occurred in China in 2019 and WHO declared it a pandemic in March 2020, we have traveled a long distance in terms of diagnosis, management, and prevention of covid19 disease. Initially thought to be a respiratory illness and later on found to have multisystem involvement our disease perspective has changed and still evolving.

Mild to moderate symptoms are most common and occurs in approximately 81% of patients, severe symptoms in 14% and only around 5% are critical.
The cardiovascular system is usually also affected in severe to critical cases with complications including myocardial injury, myocarditis (inflammation of heart muscles), acute myocardial infarction, heart failure, rhythm abnormalities, and venous thromboembolic events.

Diagnosis of myocarditis in recovered covid patients should be reserved for those who have clinical symptoms like chest pain, breathlessness, and exercise intolerance with objective evidence of myocardial injuries like increased troponin level, heart rhythm abnormalities, and wall motion abnormalities on echo or chronic inflammatory findings on CMR.

Due to concern for myocarditis-related heart rhythm abnormalities that may occur in the setting of ongoing inflammation, it is recommended that athletic patients should avoid competition for 3 to 6 months. Cardiovascular risk assessment (treadmill test, ECHO, and 24 hr. Holter) is recommended for mild symptoms lasting longer than 10 days, for moderate or severe symptoms including hospitalization, advanced cardiac testing is recommended depending upon symptoms and abnormal findings in baseline testing.

What are some myths about the covid-19 vaccine?
","Most people are all set to get vaccinated as it’s the first step to mitigating the spread of coronavirus. Organizations should check local COVID-19 vaccine availability, and know who is eligible and when and how vaccination can be received while maintaining the social distancing and safety guidelines in check. Unfortunately, you may come across some wrong information related to vaccines and their development which can lead to hesitancy on your part. In this blog, we separate the vaccine myths from facts to empower you to make the right decision.

MYTH: After getting COVID-19, I don’t need to get a vaccine.

FACT: People who have been infected with coronavirus may still have the benefits of getting a vaccine. Due to the severe health risk associated with COVID-19 and the fact that re-infection is possible, you’re advised to get a COVID-19 vaccine even if you have been sick with COVID-19 before. There is insufficient information available currently to support how long people are protected after getting COVID-19 (natural immunity). Some early evidence recommended natural immunity for coronavirus may not last for extended periods though studies are still ongoing. Moreover, most experts believe that vaccines provide better protection for coronavirus than natural infection.

MYTH: Specific blood types have less severe COVID-19 infections, so getting a vaccine isn’t required. 

FACT: According to expert research, there is no reason to support that a particular blood type will lead to more severity of coronavirus. By opting to get vaccinated, you’re protecting not only yourself and your loved ones but your community too.

MYTH: The COVID-19 vaccine is risky because it was developed so quickly.

FACT: All the authorized vaccines for coronavirus are tested, approved, and proven safe and effective. Even though they were developed quickly, they have undergone the same strict Food and Drug Administration procedures as other vaccines, meeting all safety norms and standards. Most importantly, no steps were skipped. Instead, it was such a massive success that experts with unprecedented global collaboration and investment were able to develop vaccines in such a short timeframe. In addition, all the clinical trials and safety reviews took the same amount of time as various other vaccines.

MYTH: The fatality rate of COVID-19 is so low, so I don’t have to get vaccinated.

FACT: Vaccines are made to reduce the risk of severe infection and the need to be hospitalized. People who are vaccinated are potentially less likely to transmit the COVID-19 disease. When many people are vaccinated, it will protect the community involving the vulnerable, underprivileged, and those who can’t be vaccinated. While vaccination is voluntary, all medically eligible people are encouraged to get the vaccine.

MYTH: Getting the COVID-19 vaccine leads to the COVID-19 virus.

FACT: The vaccine for coronavirus can’t and will not give you COVID-19. Moreover, the two authorized mRNA vaccines direct your cells to reproduce a protein that is part of the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus, which guides your body to identify and combat the virus if it comes along. The coronavirus vaccine doesn’t include the SARS-Co-2 virus so you won’t get COVID-19 from the vaccine.

MYTH: The COVID-19 vaccine leads to infertility in women.

 FACT: A lot of false information on social media suggests that the COVID-19 vaccine instructs the body to attack syncytin-1, a protein in the placenta, which could cause infertility in women. In reality, there’s an amino acid sequence shared between a placental protein and spike protein; though, experts explain it’s too short of triggering an immune response and thus doesn’t affect fertility.

MYTH: The coronavirus vaccine enters your cells and alters your DNA.

FACT: The coronavirus vaccines are well-designed to support your body’s immune system in the battle against the COVID-19 virus. The messenger RNA from two of the first kinds of COVID-19 vaccines does enter your cells, but not in the nucleus of the cells where DNA lies. Moreover, the mRNA performs its job to lead the cells to generate protein to restore the immune system, and then it immediately breaks down without affecting your DNA.

MYTH: I’m not at risk for severe complications of COVID-19, so I shouldn’t get the vaccine.

FACT: Regardless of the risk, you can still get in contact with the coronavirus and spread it to others around. That’s why you must get vaccinated. After the COVID-19 vaccines are widely available, it’s suggested that as many eligible candidates as possible should get the vaccine. It’s not only to protect you and your family but the community as well.

MYTH: The side effects of the coronavirus vaccine are life-threatening.

FACT: Some coronavirus vaccines can have side effects, but the considerable majority experience only mild effects such as pain where they were injected, body aches, or fever, lasting for a day or two. There are some signs that the vaccine is working to stimulate your immune system. If these symptoms stay after two days, ensure to consult your doctor. If you experience allergies, particularly severe ones, discuss information about if and how you can get vaccines safely.

MYTH: You can’t get COVID-19 after vaccination.

FACT: The coronavirus vaccine is not 100% effective, so it’s possible to get the infection. A few weeks after you get the second dose of the vaccine, you’re fully vaccinated and 90% less likely to get infected by the COVID-19 virus. The vaccine will likely keep you from getting severely sick with the infection but won’t stop the virus from entering your body. Ensure to practice social distancing and wear masks in public areas even after getting vaccinated.

MYTH: You don’t have to wear a mask after getting vaccinated for COVID-19.

FACT: It will take a lot of time for people to get vaccinated for the coronavirus. Even though the COVID-19 vaccine may prevent you from being severely sick, it’s currently unknown if you can still transfer and spread the virus to others around. Until further studies are done related to the vaccine and virus, it’s suggested to take precautions like mask-wearing, hand washing, and social distancing.

In conclusion, avoid trusting any piece of information you see or read online related to COVID-19 vaccination which is not from verified sources. Instead, get in touch with your doctor, and read articles and blogs from healthcare providers themselves or government sources of information on vaccines.

746,746,How to use a face mask correctly? ,"In current times when the novel CoronaVirus is spreading at a furious pace, it has become mandatory for people to wear a mask when stepping out of their homes and when going to public places.

Wearing a mask helps you protect yourself from contracting the highly contagious coronavirus that spreads through droplets released when a person coughs or sneezes. A mask is a malleable sheet of cloth or any other membrane that is put around your face to cover your nose and mouth. It is rectangular and circular with two elastic nooses at the edges to help users fasten them behind their neck or head to hold the mask in place. The mask filters out large microbes, dust, and pollutants from entering your trachea either from your nose or mouth.

They are also designed in a way that facilitates the absorption of moisture that builds up when a person exhales into the mask.

747,747,When should you wear a mask?,"If you notice that you are in respiratory distress and are coughing and sneezing frequently, it is advised to wear a mask. By doing this, you are limiting the spread of the pathogens inside you and not infecting others with your condition. It is especially important now as you may be a dormant vector of corona fever which is asymptomatic, and by wearing a mask, you are breaking the chain of new infections. You should also wear a mask whenever you are stepping out in public and find yourself in large gatherings. As a safety precaution, ensure that you maintain a distance of 6 feet from another human being. Many of us are not very comfortable wearing a mask and doing a half-hearted job because the law asks us to do it. Please remember that wearing a mask could prevent you and another human just like you from contracting a deadly condition that currently has no cure.

Here are a few tips for correctly wearing your mask to ensure maximum efficiency:

Always wear a mask that is free from wear and tear and has no visible gaps or holes.
Wash your hand with soap or rub it with a disinfectant for at least 20 seconds before putting your mask on.
The colored side of the mask faces out while the white side faces in.
If you are using disposable masks, dispose of them regularly.
If you are using a mask made of cloth, ensure that you wash them regularly with a disinfectant or industrial wash soap to kill all the germs and bacteria that could have accumulated during the period of use.
Always cover your nose and your mouth properly and remember to fasten both the loops behind your ear or your face to keep the mask positioned in place.
If your mask has a metallic strip, ensure that it is positioned against the ridge of your nose and press the metallic strip to take the shape of your nose.
Do not touch the mask with your hands once you’ve put them on.
If you are disposing of a mask, ensure that the mask is properly wrapped in a disposable polythene bag, and don’t dispose of them in open dustbins.
Wash your hands thoroughly for 20 seconds with soap or a disinfectant after disposing of the mask.
Do not reuse single-use surgical masks.
Do not wear the mask below your nose. Use the mask to cover your mouth and your nose.
Do not crisscross the elastic bands used to fasten them around your face as it may leave huge openings. It is thereby reducing its efficiency.
Use N95 masks instead of surgical masks as they fit you more efficiently and leave no gap for particles to enter. They are also better at filtering out micro pathogens.
An N95 mask is capable of filtering up to 95% of minute test particles (under 0.3 microns) effectively. However, even an N95 mask has its limitations.

748,748,How can you ensure that you are safe from contracting an infection during the time of the COVID pandemic?,"Wash your hands, feet, and any other exposed part of the body with soap for 20 seconds. When you are using a hand sanitizer, ensure that it has at least 60% of alcohol. Avoid venturing out to public places unless it is required. Keep a safe distance of 6 feet from other human beings. Do not touch your mask once it is on your face. If you have to remove your mask, ensure that you wash your hands for 20 seconds before touching it.



Persisting symptoms even after testing covid negative? 
India’s COVID 19 recovery rates are amongst the highest in the world due to the continued efforts of the government and Healthcare warriors from the frontline. Over 81 lakh patients have officially recovered from the COVID 19 infection in our country (till 13th November 2020).  However, there are growing reports of people experiencing what is clinically known as Post-COVID Syndrome.

Post-COVID Syndrome
Post-COVID Syndrome means that people continue to experience debilitating symptoms that persist (for days or months) even after testing negative for the virus. Persisting symptoms or Complications post COVID is not only restricted to patients with a severe case of infection (who required hospitalization), even patients who had recovered from a mild case of the virus could suffer from prolonged effects of the virus.

Persisting Symptoms post-COVID
Prolonged breathing difficulty
Extreme tiredness/weakness
Muscle or nerve weakness; numbness
Inability to walk and stumbling while walking
Mood changes or depression
Persistent diarrhea, rapid weight loss, and other Digestive issues
Trouble thinking or concentrating, dizziness, confusion
Short-term memory loss or loss of sense
Bruising & rashes on the skin
Loss of appetite, taste, and smell
Disturbed sleep pattern (insomnia)
Abnormal heart rate
Possible Complications post COVID infection
Permanent Scarring of Lungs
Deterioration in lung capacity or functioning
Inflammation in body
The weakening of nerves or muscles in the body
Reduction in Heart Functioning
Lasting Kidney or Liver damage (common in people with sepsis during COVID)
Abnormally high Sugar levels (even in people without diagnosed diabetes)
Heart Attack or Brain Stroke due to increased risk of Blood Clot formation
A weakened Immune system leaves you susceptible to other diseases
The blurring of vision or hearing loss
Need for a Comprehensive Post-COVID Recovery Programme

Even after testing negative, it might take weeks or months for a patient to fully recover and feel 100% active & healthy again. It is also important to note that the COVID infection may silently affect the patient’s lungs, heart, kidney, nerves, or any other organ the symptoms of which may not be noticeable immediately but may have long-term disabling effects.

Therefore, there is a need for a comprehensive program that would enable complete clinical assessment of the patient by a team of specialists who shall assess the patient’s health in its entirety, ensure that the patient gets timely diagnosis & treatment and recovers completely. The program intends to try and bring the patient to his Pre-covid state (how much ever possible) through timely diagnosis, accurate & targeted treatment, right nutritional advice & physiotherapy which aims at strengthening lungs & muscles.

749,749,CAN YOU GET REINFECTED BY COVID? HOW LONG DOES THE IMMUNITY LAST?,"Coronavirus is an infection that has caused a global pandemic, and gaining immunity against it is the only way forward. Vaccines against COVID-19 are being developed by scientists around the world and hopefully, successful coronavirus vaccination will prevent the spread of this disease. Recent news from Hong Kong has now questioned the efficacy of the developing vaccines, and whether they can prevent re-infection.

It is important to know the difference between a relapse and reinfection, how often it happens, and the measures people need to take to protect themselves when they are out in public. This helps to improve treatment procedures and get a better understanding of the novel Coronavirus. Experts suggest this is not a cause for concern and that reinfection is a very rare occurrence. From a layman’s point of view, it is important to learn the process of testing and its limitations, as well as avoid stress over COVID-19 reinfection.

One obstacle to consider is the test in itself. The RT/PCR test, which is the standardized test that is used along with the swab detects Coronavirus infection in 70% of the patients. However, 30% of the cases are prone to false negatives. Another important issue is that the test does not differentiate between live and dead viruses. So what is interpreted as reinfection, may well be dead virus particles present in recovered patients resulting in False Positives.

750,750,How do you develop immunity against Coronavirus?,"The human body has two modes of defense against invading microorganisms. The first is innate immunity, which is activated when a minute a foreign particle is detected. The release of chemicals causes inflammation and stimulates white blood cells to attack the infected cells.

The cellular response or the adaptive immune response involves the production of targeted antibodies that stick to the virus and enable T cells to engulf the infected cells. The production of targeted antibodies takes about ten days and the sickest patients develop the strongest immune response. People who show only mild symptoms may not develop a sufficient immune response.

How long does immunity against Coronavirus last?
","How long do the antibodies last in your system after infection by Coronavirus? Like our own memory, our immune system remembers some infections very well but tends to forget some others. For example, the vaccine given for measles, the MMR vaccine, provides life-long immunity against the disease. However, some flu vaccines require an annual dose, as the antibodies last only for a limited period in the immune system.

Coronavirus has not been around long enough to exactly establish how long the antibodies against it will last, and hence, it is still a mystery if the vaccines will provide life-long immunity.

Other human Coronaviruses give us a clue about how long the targeted antibodies last in the human body. Four types of Coronaviruses that cause the common cold produce immunity that is short-lived, lasting for less than a year. However, once infected, COVID-19 re-infection is generally milder, which is also expected with COVID-19.

752,752,Have people caught COVID-19 twice?,"Until recently, many cases of re-infection with COVID-19 have been reported. However, these were considered errors with people wrongly being told they were free of the virus after infection. In other words, a relapse of the disease was mistaken as re-infection.
A 33-year-old man from Hong Kong was infected with Coronavirus for the second time after four months. This was the first proven case of a re-infection by Coronavirus, as Genome Sequencing confirmed that the two virus strains were different. However, the patient showed no symptoms after re-infection. This makes it a textbook case demonstrating that infection by virus produces immunity against the disease on re-infection. This means that the body had produced antibodies against the virus the first time he was infected. These antibodies prevented the appearance of any symptoms of re-infection by Coronavirus.

This demonstrates that the antibodies provide protection from COVID-19, but may not prevent getting infected again and harboring the virus in your system. This could mean that a person who recovered from COVID-19, if re-infected, can still be a source of infection for those who are not protected from the virus.

Experts say that re-infection, though not impossible, is usually very rare. Also, one case cannot be considered a conclusive study. Limited experiments done on Rhesus monkeys show that when re-infected with Coronavirus causing COVID-19 after three weeks, they did not develop any symptoms. However, it is yet to be found out how long immunity against Coronavirus lasts and whether it prevents re-infection.

753,753,Do antibodies against Coronavirus make me immune?,"The presence of antibodies does not guarantee immunity. It has also been seen that the levels of antibodies vary depending on the severity of the symptoms developed. This can especially be problematic when immunity passports are considered a way out of the pandemic. If there are antibodies in a person’s system, they are assumed to be eligible to go back to work. This was particularly considered for frontline workers in the health sector who have a high risk of exposure to Coronavirus. While every patient who is infected by COVID-19 develops antibodies, the levels are not the same. Studies have shown up to 30% of the patients who have been infected with COVID-19 show very low levels of neutralizing antibodies (antibodies that attach to Coronavirus and stop them from infecting other cells). Also, being immune to the virus does not mean you cannot harbor the virus and spread it to vulnerable groups in society.","['back', 'particularli', 'frontlin', 'assum', 'elig', 'immun', 'passport', 'develop', 'cell', 'harbor', 'societi', 'seen', 'vari', 'consid', 'level', 'patient', 'coronaviru', 'sector', 'also', 'guarante', 'shown', 'vulner', 'especi', 'viru', 'neutral', 'antibodi', 'attach', 'infect', 'problemat', 'presenc']"
754,754,Why is immunity important?,"Having immunity protects you from the disease and reduces the effect of the virus on your body. Understanding who is at risk of catching and spreading the infection is essential to ease the lockdown regulations. The duration of immunity attained either by infection or by vaccination will decide how effectively the virus can be contained. How long the antibodies and immunity against the virus lasts will also decide if the vaccine is effective life-long, or requires annual shots.

755,755,What is a vaccine?,"A vaccine is a substance that is prepared from a disease-causing pathogen or organism that causes a disease or its parts or substances that replicate the organism.

756,756,How do vaccines work?,"A vaccine works by enabling your body’s immune system to identify and combat pathogenic organisms. This is done by introducing either weakened organisms or proteins used to identify the organisms into your body. The immune system identifies these structures known as antigens as foreign and produces antibodies to combat them. When the organism infects the body in the future, there is an aggravated response by the immune system to produce antibodies against it due to what is known as immunological memory. Immunological memory is the ability of the immune system to respond more rapidly and effectively to a previously encountered pathogen. This provides immunity against the disease.

757,757,What is the link?,"When enough people in a population are protected from disease by vaccination, the chances of an outbreak are very less. There aren’t sufficient hosts for the pathogenic organism to survive in the population and the disease will die out completely. This protects others in a population as well who are not vaccinated.

Is there a vaccine for COVID-19 yet?
","It seems like we are stuck in a state of quiescence, with no end in sight. Currently, the only way to contain the virus in the absence of a vaccine is by following practices of social distancing, wearing masks, and avoiding crowds along with testing and tracing of contacts. However, these methods are not fool-proof and are difficult to follow all the time. Russia announced the approval of its COVID-19 vaccine in August. However, whether adequate research and trials have gone into its release is still under speculation.

The United States Government has promised funding of up to ten billion dollars for a program known as Operation Warp Speed. This aims to significantly reduce the time to develop a vaccine and complete clinical trials as well as ensure rapid production of millions of doses as soon as FDA approval is obtained. Promising vaccines for COVID-19 are under development in India, The United Kingdom, The United States of America, and China. However, scientists have not been able to develop effective vaccines against the Coronavirus family of viruses till today. It is also still not known if these viruses can mutate to escape the body’s immune system even after vaccination.

759,759,How are vaccines made?,"Scientists have developed different types of vaccines and many ways of injecting antigens from organisms into the human body without causing any harm, but still stimulating the immune system:Live attenuated vaccines: A weaker or inactive form of viruses or bacterias are used for these vaccines. Though these antigens will not cause disease, they will stimulate the immune system to produce antibodies against them. Since these are actual live pathogens, they are very effective and provide life-long immunity. However, these vaccines cannot be offered to people with a compromised immune system such as those suffering from AIDS, for example. This is because they may cause the disease in such people. Another important factor to keep in mind is that these vaccines should always be refrigerated and maintained at the ideal temperature, to prevent them from dying.
Examples of live attenuated vaccines include the live viral vaccine known as MMR vaccine given for immunity against measles, mumps, and rubella in combination and the BCG vaccine for Tuberculosis. Certain influenza vaccines are also live attenuated.

Inactivated or killed vaccines: The pathogenic organism is killed using heat or chemicals and these dead cells are injected into the body. Even though the cells are dead, they can stimulate the immune system by means of the proteins coating their surface. Inactivated vaccines are safer to inject into immunocompromised individuals, as they pose no risk of causing disease. These vaccines can be stored in deep freezers and are generally safer.
Examples of inactivated vaccines include the Injectable Polio Vaccine (IPV), Hepatitis A vaccine, and the Rabies vaccine.

Subunit vaccines: Subunit vaccines are those which are prepared using a protein or carbohydrate removed from the organism and injected to create an immune response. These vaccines are harder to prepare since the component isolated must stimulate the immune system accurately. These vaccines are very safe, with a very low risk of adverse reactions. Vaccines for Hepatitis B, Human Papillomavirus, Pertussis, and Meningococci are all examples of subunit vaccines.
Toxoid vaccines: Some organisms cause diseases in man by producing toxic compounds. These toxins are made inactive by being treated with chemical agents and then used as a vaccine. These inactive toxins are sufficient to create an immune response. Diphtheria and Tetanus vaccines are made from inactive toxins.
Conjugate vaccines: Some bacteria, like the Haemophilus influenzae B bacteria (HiB), are coated by carbohydrates that mask the pathogen and make it difficult for the immune system to identify it as a foreign particle. This is bypassed by attaching the carbohydrate coat with known antigens. This enables the immune system to identify the coat as a target pathogen and promotes an effective immune reaction. Such vaccines, which use a known antigen tagged onto the coating of the organism are called conjugate vaccines. Another example is the Pneumococcal Conjugate Vaccine or the PCV.

DNA vaccines: DNA vaccines are made by extracting a component of the DNA of the pathogen which is injected into the body. This DNA would instruct the immune cells to combat the antigens. They are cheap, easy to produce, and are very efficient trainers of the immune system. DNA vaccines are still under research and are not ready for mass production yet.
Recombinant vaccines: Also known as Recombinant vector vaccines, these are similar to DNA vaccines in that part of the pathogen’s DNA is inserted into the host’s cells, instructing the immune system to combat the organism. In order to insert the DNA, they use an inactivated bacterium or virus as a carrier. Currently, recombinant vaccines are being developed for Measles, Rabies, and HIV.


Vaccination for babies and children during COVID-19: What is recommended?
This is a common query for parents and has been addressed by the World Health Organisation (WHO). WHO has stated that irrespective of the global pandemic, it is still important for babies to get vaccinated in the second, fourth, sixth, twelfth, and thirteenth months. Most children do not get severely ill from a Coronavirus infection, but vaccine-preventable diseases can be very dangerous if contracted.  So, it is best to stick to your child’s vaccination schedule and avoid missing their shots.

760,760,Can herd immunity help in preventing COVID-19?,"India has a population of 1.3 billion and by the time I finish this sentence, there would be 10 new people born here. From that perspective, it is important for our leaders to develop smart strategies to make sure that we save most of our population within our existing resources. One such strategy is social distancing. There is more to it. Let’s first understand the concept of herd immunit. Herd immunity is a type of immunity that automatically triggers non-vaccinated individuals if a lot of people around them have developed immunity either due to vaccination or naturally after getting cured from an infection. Elderly
Children
Pregnant females
Patients with chronic illness or are on immune suppressants

The problem with herd immunity for COVID 19:
Vaccine for Covid 19 is still in the second phase of its development (another 6-8 months to go)
Lack of research work and studies to support medication management for Covid 19
If it can affect mankind again
Some unanswered questions like
Severe manifestations and deaths in certain cases and why
Infections in the elderly and severity of manifestations and the like

Facts and figures from previous pandemics
As reported from sources herd immunity comes into play if 40 percent of a country's population has reached immunity, either through vaccination or naturally. This is known as the herd immunity threshold. To stop the spread of the pandemic, at least 80 percent of the country’s population must have attained immunity. Example: Measles is one such disease. Measles is on the verge of elimination due to the same. Every 18 to 19 people out of 20 have already been vaccinated or have had the disease; therefore the remaining two will never get the disease.

761,761,What happens after a person gets infected?,"As you have already studied many times during your schooling period, after any infection the body cell fight the infection and develops specific antibodies that are well versed in fighting that specific infection. Not only this, the body’s immune system remembers and keeps stock of such antibodies, in case the infection reoccurs.

762,762,What is the BA.2 sublineage of omicron?,"Although BA.2 has been described as a subvariant of omicron, scientists point out it is quite different  as different from omicron as the delta variant is from the alpha variant, said Jeremy Luban, a virologist at the University of Massachusetts Medical School. There is no evidence BA.2 makes people sicker than its omicron progenitor, and experts say vaccines will continue to protect against severe outcomes from BA.2 as they have in cases involving other variants.

Is BA.2 sparking another surge of cases?
","So far, no broad surge of new cases has emerged in the United States, despite upticks in several nations in Europe and Asia. There are so many variables at work when it comes to coronavirus transmission  including a population’s level of protection from vaccinations and prior infections, and its behavior, perhaps the hardest factor to predict or measure  that disease experts cannot say with confidence whether and when a new wave will materialize. If a surge of significant magnitude were to occur, it would be the sixth since the virus’s arrival in early 2020.

764,764,Where was the original version of omicron confirmed?,"Omicron was first reported in late November, but its exact origin is still unknown. Scientists in South Africa confirmed on Nov. 25 that they had detected a worrying variant. Days later, other nations including the Netherlands said they had reviewed genetic sequencing data and found that the variant was already circulating within their borders at the same time as when South Africa raised the alarm. The World Health Organization soon listed it as a variant of concern. In South Africa, where official statistics show that more than 43 percent of the adult population is fully vaccinated, the variant spread rapidly. By Dec. 14, the positivity rate hit 34.9 percent. However, by late December, South Africa’s top infectious-disease scientist said that the country had passed the peak of new omicron cases.

The first confirmed case in the United States was reported in California on Dec. 1, and within weeks, it had been detected in all 50 states.

By late December, the seven-day daily average coronavirus case count in the United States had surpassed the delta-driven summer surge, Washington Post figures show. And, by the next month, the number of new daily cases had surpassed 700,000. But cases and hospitalizations have significantly declined. As of March 2, cases had dropped to about 75,000 per day, the CDC said, though data shows the virus is still circulating throughout communities in the United States.

765,765,What do we know about omicron?,"Omicron’s genetic profile is unique compared with other circulating variants, meaning it represents a new lineage of the virus. It is distinct from other variants in another crucial way: There is a greater number of mutations. Omicron has more than 30 genetic changes in the spike protein, the part of the virus that binds to human cells and allows it to gain entry.

Scientists were worried that those mutations would make omicron more transmissible, even among those with a natural or vaccine-acquired immune response  and they appear to have been right. Antibodies defeat the virus by targeting spike proteins, but changes that alter the structure can prevent them from binding as they usually do to neutralize the target. The omicron variant probably picked up genetic material from a virus that causes the common cold in humans, according to a preliminary study by researchers from Nference, a Cambridge, Mass.-based firm that analyzes biomedical information. Venky Soundararajan, a biological engineer who co-wrote the study, noted that as a virus evolves to become more transmissible, it generally loses traits that cause severe symptoms  although he said more analysis is needed.  

Studies have suggested that in many cases, omicron has caused less severe disease than previous variants  and may even be more likely to lead to asymptomatic infections. But because it is so contagious, the large number of infections could still result in a sizable number of severe cases, some experts have said. Although omicron appears to be more adept at evading antibodies, so far, data has suggested that the vaccines, particularly after a booster shot, still offer protection, namely against severe disease.

766,766,Why is it called omicron?,"The World Health Organization named the B.1.1.529 variant omicron in the tradition of giving variants a Greek letter name. After the most recently named variant, mu, officials chose to skip the next letters available for variants: nu and xi. Nu is too easily confounded with ‘new,’ and Xi was not used because it is a common surname, the WHO said in a statement to The Washington Post. The agency’s best practices for naming new diseases suggest avoiding ‘causing offense to any cultural, social, national, regional, professional or ethnic groups,’  the WHO noted.

767,767,What has been done to halt the spread of omicron?,"The international response initially focused on two fronts: travel restrictions and encouraging more people to get vaccinated. Within days of the discovery of the variant, several countries began curbing flights to and from South Africa and its neighbors to try to slow omicron’s advance. The United States imposed restrictions on travelers from Botswana, Eswatini, Lesotho, Malawi, Mozambique, Namibia, South Africa and Zimbabwe, though they have since been lifted. Still, all inbound international travelers to the United States age 2 and older must show a negative coronavirus test result, with the test taken no more than one day before departure, regardless of nationality or vaccination status. Those who recently had covid-19 may alternatively show documentation that they tested positive no more than 90 days before departure  and have recovered. Health experts recommend getting tested at a testing center, even pharmacies and local health departments  but not emergency departments. Not only does this clog up emergency rooms for people who need them, but it also creates a risk of exposure to covid-19  both for the person unnecessarily visiting the ER and for others who are waiting for care, said William Schaffner, medical director of the National Foundation for Infectious Diseases.

President Biden also announced that the federal mask mandate requiring travelers to wear masks on planes, buses and in transportation hubs has been extended through March 18. The CDC’s new covid-19 community levels framework does not affect travel requirements at this time, including wearing masks on public transportation, according to the CDC. U.S. public health authorities have also re-upped efforts to get shots into arms, including boosters for those who have already been fully vaccinated. The CDC recently expanded its recommendation on booster shots, stating that people 12 and older should get a booster five months after the initial Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine series, and those 18 and older should get boosted five months after the initial Pfizer or Moderna series or two months after the Johnson & Johnson shot.

And despite the recent relaxation of mask recommendations, federal health authorities still recommend that everyone age 2 and older wear a mask in indoor public spaces in areas where the covid-19 community level is high. In addition, the CDC said people should avoid crowds and poorly ventilated areas, wash hands frequently, and, when needed, get tested and isolate to protect others.

768,768,"Do we know whether vaccines are effective against omicron?
","Several studies have shown the Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna vaccines remained highly effective at preventing the worst outcomes from omicron infections even as protection against mild illness waned. The nearly 17 million Americans who received the one-shot Johnson & Johnson coronavirus vaccine were less protected against serious illness and hospitalization. Studies also show that fully vaccinated individuals who received a booster shot had robust protection against the omicron variant. But officials worry about lags in getting Americans to sign up for booster shots, which were also shown to increase protection against omicron. More than 97 million people in the United States have gotten the extra shots, of 217 million who are fully vaccinated, according to the CDC as of March 28.

In the first in-depth laboratory study on omicron, scientists in South Africa found that omicron was able to elude a great deal of the protection provided by disease-fighting antibodies. But the study, a preprint that has not yet been peer-reviewed, also said that previous infection followed by vaccination or a booster shot was likely to confer protection from severe disease in Omicron infection, suggesting boosters could be important. One recent study showed omicron-fighting antibodies persisted for four months after a third dose of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine, suggesting that a fourth shot may not be immediately necessary. And a similar study found that the Moderna booster remained effective against the variant in laboratory tests for at least six months. In the event that vaccines lose some of their punch, vaccine makers say they could also adjust their formulas relatively quickly to target omicron.

Given the spread of omicron in South Africa, several experts have pointed to the need to vaccinate underserved countries to bolster the world’s protection from future, more-evasive variants. I think vaccine equity is a really important issue, said Linda Bauld, a professor of public health at the University of Edinburgh. She noted the low vaccination rates in many African countries and the fact that high prevalence of the virus means it can undergo many genetic changes each time it jumps between individuals. However, Bauld added, transmission of the coronavirus probably will not be eliminated even with a vaccine, as seen with the delta variant, with mutations ultimately able to occur in any country.

769,769,"Does omicron cause severe illness, and do existing treatments work?","Current data indicates that the omicron variant causes milder cases of covid-19 than the delta variant  but scientists warn it can still be dangerous, especially to vulnerable populations, such as those who are not vaccinated. A major private study by Discovery Health, South Africa’s largest health insurer, published in December, found omicron appears to cause less severe illness than earlier coronavirus variants but is more resistant to the two-dose Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine widely. The scientists found that risk of hospital admissions among adults who developed covid-19 was 29 percent lower than in the initial pandemic wave that emerged March 2020. Two companies that have developed monoclonal antibodies, which are designed to prevent severe illness, recently announced contrasting findings on the potency of such therapies against omicron.

Regeneron Pharmaceuticals said in a news release that data confirms its therapy, REGEN-COV, has diminished potency against omicron but remains useful against the delta variant, which is still the dominant strain in the U.S. At the same time, AstraZeneca said a lab study of Evusheld, its coronavirus antibody cocktail, found that the treatment retained neutralizing activity against omicron. U.S. public health officials began stockpiling a monoclonal antibody treatment called sotrovimab in December. Laboratory studies have shown that the intravenous infusion from Vir Biotechnology and GlaxoSmithKline will hold up against the new variant.

771,771,What causes symptoms in COVID long haulers?,"SARS-CoV-2 can attack the body in a range of ways, causing damage to the lungs, heart, nervous system, kidneys, liver and other organs. Mental health problems can arise from grief and loss, unresolved pain or fatigue, or from post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) after treatment in the intensive care unit (ICU). Doctors are seeing a spectrum of symptoms after acute COVID-19, some of which would be expected after other critical illnesses. Some are minor, but other people may need continuing care and even readmission to the hospital. Similar, lingering problems can affect patients with other serious illnesses. But it is notable that post-COVID-19 syndrome is not just afflicting people who were very sick with the coronavirus: Some patients who were never severely ill with COVID-19 are experiencing long-term symptoms.

772,772,"
Do COVID vaccines prevent long COVID?
","Getting vaccinated for COVID-19 lowers the risks of COVID infection. While breakthrough infections are possible, being fully vaccinated and boosted is effective in reducing the risk of hospitalization and death due to COVID. Research is ongoing about how long COVID affects people who had breakthrough COVID, but it is likely that being vaccinated reduces the risk.
Breathing Issues after COVID-19: A bad case of COVID-19 can produce scarring and other permanent problems in the lungs, but even mild infections can cause persistent shortness of breath  getting winded easily after even light exertion. Lung recovery after COVID-19 is possible, but takes time. Experts say it can take months for a person’s lung function to return to pre-COVID-19 levels. Breathing exercises and respiratory therapy can help.

Heart Problems in COVID Long Haulers: SARS-CoV-2 infection can leave some people with heart problems, including inflammation of the heart muscle. In fact, one study showed that 60% of people who recovered from COVID-19 had signs of ongoing heart inflammation, which could lead to the common symptoms of shortness of breath, palpitations and rapid heartbeat. This inflammation appeared even in those who had had a mild case of COVID-19 and who had no medical issues before they got sick.

Loss of Taste and Smell after COVID-19
The senses of smell and taste are related, and because the coronavirus can affect cells in the nose, having COVID-19 can result in lost or distorted senses of smell (anosmia) or taste. Before and after people become ill with COVID-19, they might lose their sense of smell or taste entirely, or find that familiar things smell or taste bad, strange or different. For about a quarter of people with COVID-19 who have one or both of these symptoms, the problem resolves in a couple of weeks. But for most, these symptoms persist. Though not life-threatening, prolonged distortion of these senses can be devastating and can lead to lack of appetite, anxiety and depression. Some studies suggest that there’s a 60% to 80% chance that these people will see improvement in their sense of smell within a year.

Neurologic Problems in Long COVID
Neurologist Arun Venkatesan, M.D., Ph.D., says, Some individuals develop medium to long-term symptoms following COVID infection, including brain fog, fatigue, headaches and dizziness.  The cause of these symptoms is unclear but is an active area of investigation.

Cognitive Problems and Mental Health after COVID-19
Can COVID-19 increase a person’s risk for anxiety, depression and cognitive issues? A study of COVID-19’s impact on mental and emotional well-being conducted by Johns Hopkins experts in psychiatry, cognition (thinking, reasoning and remembering) and mental health found that these problems were common among a diverse sample of COVID-19 survivors. Cognitive impairment after acute coronavirus infection can have a severe impact on a person’s life. Long-haul COVID patients may experience changes in the way they think, concentrate, speak and remember, and these symptoms can affect their ability to work or even maintain activities of daily living.
After recovering from the coronavirus, some people are left with lingering anxiety, depression and other post-COVID mental health issues. Physical changes such as pain and weakness can be complicated by long periods of isolation, stress from job loss and financial difficulties, and grief from the deaths of loved ones and the loss of good health.

Post-Intensive Care Syndrome
Patients who were hospitalized for COVID-19 treatment have a particularly challenging recovery. Experts note that post-intensive care syndrome, or PICS, puts COVID-19 survivors and other people who have spent time in the ICU at a higher risk for problems with mental health, cognition and physical recovery. Megan Hosey, Ph.D., a rehabilitation psychologist, says that prolonged time in the ICU can cause delirium. The strange surroundings, multiple mind-altering medications, isolation and loss of control can leave patients with lasting and recurrent sensations of terror or dread, including post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Many patients have hallucinations where they believe that medical providers are trying to harm them, Hosey says. We've had patients tell us things like ‘I thought I was being buried alive’ when they were being put into an MRI.

POTS and Insomnia after COVID-19
Postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome, or POTS, is a condition that affects blood circulation, and people who have survived COVID-19 may be more vulnerable to it. Tae Chung, M.D., who specializes in physical medicine and rehabilitation, says POTS can leave survivors with other neurologic symptoms, including continuing headache, fatigue, brain fog, difficulties in thinking or concentrating, and insomnia.
Persistent post-COVID-19 insomnia, or COVID-somnia is an increasingly common complaint among COVID-19 survivors and can be a typical symptom of POTS.

Diabetes after COVID-19
The relationship between COVID-19 and diabetes, especially type 2 diabetes, is complex. Type 2 diabetes is a risk factor for serious cases of COVID-19, and some survivors of the illness seem to be developing type 2 diabetes signs after they recover from COVID-19.

Long COVID Symptoms in Children and Teens
It’s not yet known whether children who have had COVID-19 are more or less likely than adults to experience continuing symptoms. But long-term COVID-19 in children is a possibility, showing up as fatigue, headaches, difficulty with school work, mood concerns, shortness of breath and other long-hauler symptoms.

Amanda Morrow, M.D., a specialist in physical medicine and rehabilitation, is part of the multidisciplinary team at Kennedy Krieger Institute’s Pediatric Post COVID-19 Rehabilitation Clinic, which addresses lingering coronavirus symptoms in children and teens. She says it isn't clear why long COVID-19 symptoms affect some children and not others. We are seeing patients who are often very high-functioning, healthy children who did not have any previous illnesses or medical conditions, she says, noting that many of the kids being treated at the clinic only had mild bouts of COVID-19. Heart inflammation after COVID-19 is a concern, especially among young athletes returning to their sports after a mild or even asymptomatic case of the coronavirus. They should be screened for any signs of heart damage to ensure it is safe for them to resume activity.

Kids who have experienced the uncommon but serious complication of COVID-19 called multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children, or MIS-C, can be left with serious heart damage, and should be followed by a pediatric cardiologist.

Long-term COVID-19 problems challenge health care, too
Brigham says that the sheer scale of caring for patients with lingering COVID-19 symptoms is a serious challenge. She notes that clinicians saw post-viral symptoms in patients affected by two other coronavirus diseases  severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS).
But, she says, outbreaks of those diseases were limited. Millions more people have had COVID-19 than SARS or MERS, so the potential problem of lingering health problems is huge, particularly in the context of the pandemic, with isolation, economic disadvantage, lack of access and changed daily routines further compounding the complexities of long-term COVID-19 care.

776,776,How to Get Involved in Long COVID Research?,"The National Institutes of Health (NIH) is conducting a research project, called the RECOVER Initiative, to understand how people recover from a COVID-19 infection and why some people do not fully recover and develop long COVID or post-COVID conditions. In March 2020, Rabbi Jonathan Sacks, an influential figure in British intellectual life, described the COVID-19 catastrophe as the nearest we have to a revelation for atheists.

At the time I thought the comparison was apt. It captured the biblical sense of shock that many of us felt in the face of such a sudden, extreme, and swiftly accelerating crisis. We have been coasting along for more than half a century, he remarked, and all at once we are facing the fragility and vulnerability of the human situation. Now, a few months on, Rabbi Sacks’ comparison with revelation still seems fitting, but for a different reason, and one that matters for thinking about a world after COVID-19. This crisis is alarming, in part, because it has several new and unfamiliar features. A global medical emergency caused by a virus we still do not fully understand. A self-inflicted economic catastrophe as a necessary policy response to contain its spread.

And yet as time has passed, it has also become clear that much of what is most distressing about this crisis is not new at all. Striking variations in COVID-19 infections and outcomes appear to reflect existing economic inequalities. Remarkable mismatches between the social value of what key workers do and the low wages they receive follow from the familiar failure of the market to value adequately what really matters.

The happy embrace of disinformation and misinformation about the virus was to be expected, given a decade of rising populism and declining faith in experts. And the absence of a properly coordinated international response ought to have come as no surprise, given the celebration of my country first global politics in recent years. The crisis then is a revelation in a far more literal senseit is focusing our collective attention on the many injustices and weaknesses that already exist in how we live together. If people were blind to these faults before, it is hard not to see them now.

777,777,"What will the world look like after COVID-19?
","Many of the problems we will face in the next decade will simply be more extreme versions of those that we already confront today. The world will only look significantly different this time if, as we emerge from this crisis, we decide to take action to resolve these problems and bring about fundamental change. The world after COVID-19 is unlikely to return to the world that was. Many trends already underway in the global economy are being accelerated by the impact of the pandemic. This is especially true of the digital economy, with the rise of digital behavior such as remote working and learning, telemedicine, and delivery services. Other structural changes may also accelerate, including regionalization of supply chains and a further explosion of cross-border data flows.

The future of work has arrived faster, along with its challengesmany of them potentially multipliedsuch as income polarization, worker vulnerability, more gig work, and the need for workers to adapt to occupational transitions. This acceleration is the result not only of technological advances but also of new considerations for health and safety, and economies and labor markets will take time to recover and will likely emerge changed. With the amplification of these trends, the realities of this crisis have triggered reconsideration of several beliefs, with possible effects on long-term choices for the economy and society. These effects range from attitudes about efficiency versus resilience, the future of capitalism, densification of economic activity and living, industrial policy, our approach to problems that affect us all and call for global and collective actionsuch as pandemics and climate changeto the role of government and institutions.

778,778,What is long COVID?,"According to Christopher Calandrella, DO, chair of emergency medicine at Long Island Jewish Forest Hills in Queens, long COVID is a term that refers to a variety of symptoms that can’t be explained by another diagnosis and last four weeks or longer after an acute COVID-19 infection.It has also been referred to as post-COVID conditions, post-COVID Syndrome or PASC (post-acute sequelae of SARS-CoV-2), he told Healthline. Calandrella explained that symptoms patients may experience include fatigue, difficulty breathing, cough, headaches, body aches, and even cognitive symptoms affecting concentration and sleep. Patients may also experience anxiety and depression, he said. As these symptoms could be caused by many different health conditions, patients should seek medical care if they have persistent symptoms without other obvious identifiable causes. 

Findings based on surveys for this study, researchers surveyed 106 people recovering from COVID-19 infection at 3, 6, and 12 months after recuperating from the disease. All surveyed patients were otherwise healthy, and had no pre-existing autoimmune conditions or other underlying diseases before the pandemic. Generally, one should not worry if they are feeling unwell right after their infection, as the chances of recovering within 12 months is very high, and just because you have typical long COVID symptoms at three months does not mean they will stay forever, senior author Dr. Manali Mukherjee, an assistant Professor of Medicine at McMaster University said in a statement.

779,779,How do I treat COVID-19 affecting a baby or child?,"With an active case of COVID-19, it’s important to talk with a doctor to determine what type of treatment is needed. Depending on your child’s age and the severity of their illness, a doctor may recommend different treatments. A very mild case may just need home remedies and rest. Others might be better served by introducing a therapeutic or antiviral medication. Regardless of which option a doctor recommends, keeping your little one hydrated and trying as best as possible to isolate them from other members of the household is important. Preventive solutions are often best at minimizing your child’s risk of severe COVID-19. This means that if your child is of an approved age to get any of the COVID-19 vaccines, it’s recommended that they get vaccinated according to the recommended schedule and receive boosters as needed.

It’s important to note that COVID-19 vaccines prevent severe infections that could lead to serious illness, hospitalization, or death. However, they do not necessarily prevent contracting the virus itself. To date, COVID-19 vaccines have been proven safe and effective for babies, children, and adults. Getting vaccinated is one of the best measures to prevent severe COVID-19. The CDCTrusted Source offers comprehensive information regarding which vaccines are approved in which age groups, and the recommended schedules for receiving them. The bottom line COVID-19 continues to be an issue of concern. While babies and children tend to contract the coronavirus less frequently and usually develop a milder case of COVID-19, they are not immune to it.

To date, vaccination is the best preventive method to reduce the chances of hospitalization, getting very sick, or dying from COVID-19. If your baby or child contracts the coronavirus, seeking immediate medical attention can ensure that they receive treatment that can help recovery and reduce symptoms. When in doubt, follow the guidelines as outlined by authoritative health organizations such as the CDC and NIH. If your child has any COVID-19 symptoms, get them tested.

New research published this month in the European Respiratory Journal finds that regardless of severity, about 75% of people will recover from long COVID within 12 months. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) anyone who has experienced COVID-19 infection can experience long COVID symptoms, even those who had a mild illness or even no symptoms at all. Researchers also discovered that patients with persistent symptoms had antibodies associated with autoimmune illnesses and elevated levels of proteins called cytokines, which can cause inflammation.

780,780,How common is COVID-19 in babies and kids?,"Anyone can contract the coronavirus and develop COVID-19. But according to health organizations around the world, babies and children consistently tend to contract the virus less frequently and in a milder form than in older populations.

According to the American Academy of Pediatrics, as of early September 2022, there have been a total of 14.7 million cases of COVID-19 reported in children in the United States since the start of the pandemic in March 2020. That’s out of a total of 79.4 million cases across all age demographics in the country. The child case count represents 18.4% of the total U.S. case count.

781,781,How do you keep the rest of the family healthy if your child has symptoms of COVID-19?,"When you’re caring for small children, isolating them from yourself or other family members can be a tall order especially if they’re babies and not self-sufficient enough to manage basic tasks without adult supervision. In this case, you’ll want to wear a mask when interacting with your child. Wash your hands frequently to avoid transmitting the coronavirus to other surfaces or family members. Additionally, avoid sharing personal items, like cups, utensils, towels, and bedding. Likewise, be sure to regularly clean and disinfect surfaces throughout shared areas of the home, like the kitchen, living room, and bathrooms.

782,782,"What should you do if your baby or child has COVID-19 symptoms?
","If you suspect that your child may have been exposed to COVID-19, your first step should be to get them tested. While at-home tests might provide an initial answer, it’s always best to take your child to a physician or clinic for an RT-PCR test. This test type offers higher accuracy and has a lower false-positive rate. Plan to keep your child at home from day care or school if COVID-19 is suspected to reduce the risk of transmitting the virus to others. Currently, there’s only one antiviral medicationTrusted Source for COVID-19 that’s approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA)Trusted Source for use in babies and children under the age of 12: remdesivir (Veklury). It’s only administered intravenously at healthcare facilities and used for children with an increased risk of developing severe symptoms.

The CDCTrusted Source currently recommends that if your child tests positive for COVID-19, treat the day you first noticed symptoms as day 0 and the following day as day 1. The organization recommends that children be kept at home for at least 5 days. Ideally, try to isolate them from other members of the household. Depending on the severity of the disease, isolation may end on different dates. Children with mild symptoms who show improvement with no symptoms on day 5 of isolation can end isolation. If symptoms persist or worsen, continue isolation until your child is fever-free for 24 hours without the need for fever-reducing medication and until symptoms begin to improve. If you’re not sure when to end isolation, talk with a healthcare professional.

783,783,Are rapid tests accurate for babies and kids?,"A 2022 study from Germany suggests that at-home rapid antigen tests tend to be less precise or accurate than the RT-PCR test, which healthcare professionals perform. Experts have consistently questioned the effectiveness of at-home tests because of known issues regarding low sensitivity to detect the coronavirus across all age groups. This means there’s a higher possibility of false negatives for at-home rapid tests. Coupled with a heightened chance of improper nasal swabbing in younger populations, there’s an increased risk of getting incorrect results from an at-home rapid antigen test performed on children.

Parents and caregivers should keep in mind that a rapid test only offers results for a snapshot in time. It can only provide sufficient results if there’s enough viral load for the test to pick up. The coronavirus’s incubation period ranges from 2 to 14 days, with the average being 3 to 6 daysTrusted Source, depending on the coronavirus variant. So, a negative rapid test result doesn’t necessarily mean you’re in the clear if the test is taken fewer than 14 days after a known exposure. It could mean the virus is not yet detectable.

784,784,How does COVID-19 affect babies?Are there lesser-known symptoms of COVID-19 in babies and kids?,"Studies are still being conducted to determine how COVID-19 specifically affects babies. One 2022 studyTrusted Source from Poland looked at infections in infant populations (newborns up to 12 months old) during the first year of the COVID-19 pandemic (March through December 2020). 

Researchers noted the majority of cases in this group were mild. Of the infant cases reviewed — even though 94% were hospitalized — 276 cases were mild, six were moderate, 32 were asymptomatic, and none were reported as severe cases.

Similar to adults, the most common symptoms were low and high grade fevers. However, other reported symptoms included:
cough
diarrhea
loss of appetite
vomiting
rash
abdominal pain

Researchers noted that one of the most common secondary diagnoses that followed COVID-19 in infants was pneumonia. It was found in 70 of the 300 cases reviewed. On the whole, the Polish study noted that infant cases of COVID-19 tend to represent only 1% to 2% of all cases, even when looking at general case counts in other countries. But, in countries with more prevalent testing, this percentage could increase to a range of 5% to 13%. Still, infant cases were generally mild compared with adult cases, which were often more severe.

785,785,Are there lesser-known symptoms of COVID-19 in babies and kids?,"Even though children tend to have a less severe reaction to COVID-19 than older populations, one serious risk COVID-19 poses to children is the potential to develop multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C). Researchers still don’t fully understand the link between MIS-C and COVID-19. But they do know that since the appearance of the novel coronavirus, many children with MIS-C had either an earlier coronavirus infection or were exposed to someone who had COVID-19. MIS-C can affect multiple organ systems across the body, including the heart, lungs, kidneys, gastrointestinal system, and brain. If left untreated, MIS-C can be deadly. In most cases, it’s easily treated.

If your child has symptoms of MIS-C, get them evaluated by a doctor immediately. Symptoms associated with MIS-C include:
fever
bloodshot eyes
dizziness or lightheadedness
abdominal pain
diarrhea
skin rash
vomiting
Another potential symptom of COVID-19 in young children is croup. Croup is the inflammation of the airways that causes:
a barking cough
stridor (high pitched, coarse sound when breathing)
distressed breathing
If your child has symptoms of croup, it’s worth getting evaluated and tested for COVID-19 or other possible causes.

786,786,"What are the most common symptoms of COVID-19 in babies and kids?
","Experts note that COVID-19 symptoms in children are similar to those documented in adults. However, the symptoms in children are usually not as severe. In many cases, children may be asymptomatic. This means that no symptoms may be present even though they test positive.

Common symptoms of COVID-19 include:
fever
headache
fatigue
body aches or muscle pain
sore throat
cough
shortness of breath
nausea or vomiting
diarrhea
loss of taste or smell
rash, often on toes, lower extremities, or hands
It’s important to keep in mind that as new coronavirus variants emerge, new symptoms may arise. Others can shift in severity.

For example, when COVID-19 first appeared globally in 2019, a loss of smell and taste was one of the hallmark signs that a person might have contracted the virus. But with later variants, such as many of the Omicron variants, a loss of taste and smell is less frequently reported as a primary symptom, whereas a sore throat is often more common. When in doubt, it’s always best to reference the latest information shared by reliable health organizations, such as the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)Trusted Source or the National Institutes of Health (NIH). Also note that many common COVID-19 symptoms are similar to those of the common cold, flu, stomach flu, and other upper respiratory infections. Before jumping to conclusions, get your child tested to confirm they have COVID-19.

787,787,How can healthcare professionals prioritise the needs of people with long COVID?,"Standardisation should improve overall standards of care, but there should also be room for some flexibility in a treatment programme. Since long COVID can manifest in different people in different ways, a recovery programme tailored to individual needs might help. The LISTEN project (Long Covid Personalised Self-managemenT support - co-design and EvaluatioN, £1.1 million), led by Professor Fiona Jones from the University of Kingston and Professor Monica Busse of Cardiff University, aims to develop a personalised rehabilitation programme to help people recover from long COVID. The team are working with people living with, or recovered from, long COVID, including those from under-served populations. Together, they will design a package of tools and tips that people can use to enhance their own recovery. They will also train rehabilitation professionals to focus on listening to the needs of patients. This package is designed to be used along with up to six coaching sessions from rehabilitation practitioners who will deliver personalised therapy. One resource, for instance, describes how to prioritise rest during the recovery journey and why it’s so important. Long COVID is challenging for healthcare professionals because they’re used to having the answers, says Professor Jones. This is about the practitioners sitting alongside the patients and going on their journey with them.

788,788,"How can health services best support people with long COVID?
","As well as finding medicines for long COVID, we need to know which health services are most useful for people with the illness and which health professionals are best placed to help them. The LOCOMOTION study (Long Covid multidisciplinary consortium: optimising treatments and services across the NHS, £3.4 million) is led jointly by Dr Manoj Sivan at the University of Leeds and Professor Brendan Delaney at Imperial College London. It aims to develop a ‘gold standard’ approach for treating long COVID in the NHS.

LOCOMOTION is investigating how to ensure patients receive the right support from healthcare professionals, such as GPs and physiotherapists. Researchers will interview healthcare staff, and more than 5,000 patients being treated at 10 NHS sites offering long COVID services. The study will determine which services are most efficient, accessible and cost-effective. 

Co-leader Dr Manoj Sivan previously developed the first long COVID diagnostic scale, called C19-YRS. It is now widely used across the NHS for capturing the severity of symptoms that persist for longer than a month after contracting COVID-19.

Over the last 18 months, various services have emerged for long COVID patients, says Dr Sivan. But they’ve all emerged from different sectors of the healthcare system, from GPs to physiotherapists. And there’s quite a lot of variation in the care being offered. We’re trying to bring in some standardisation.

789,789,"Can medicines and vaccines help people with long COVID?
","Thanks to research such as the RECOVERY trial, several drugs have now been shown to be effective in the acute stages of COVID-19; they improve the chances that hospitalised patients will survive. But unfortunately, we don’t yet have evidence for medicines to relieve long COVID. The STIMULATE-ICP study (Symptoms, trajectory, inequalities and management: understanding Long Covid to address and transform existing integrated care pathways, £7 million), led by UCL researchers, aims to change this. 

The study is recruiting patients who have been referred to NHS long COVID clinical services. It will test the effectiveness of medicines that are used to treat other conditions. Researchers will measure the impact of three months’ treatment on people’s symptoms, their mental health, and ability to return to daily tasks such as going to work. Antihistamines, anti-clotting drugs and anti-inflammatory medicines are being tested, and other drugs may be added to this platform trial. The study will also assess whether MRI scans can help diagnose organ damage. In addition, researchers will test an app which tracks people’s symptoms and provides rehabilitation.

Long COVID patients have been neglected during the pandemic because the health service has been swamped by the acute needs of people with the virus. Because of that, we haven’t been as quick to acknowledge this new disease, says chief investigator Professor Amitava Banerjee from UCL. We would love to improve the treatment of these people.

Dr Haroon and TLC co-lead Professor Melanie Calvert, also from the University of Birmingham, are also aiming to identify treatments that are likely to help people with long COVID. The TLC study uses a digital platform to assess whether the treatments and supportive interventions reduce symptoms, improve quality of life, and are good value for money.

Vaccines are another approach. They have been shown to reduce the risk of severe acute COVID-19. Anecdotal reports suggest that long COVID patients might experience relief after receiving a COVID-19 vaccine, and a turning point in their illness. 

A team at the University of Oxford, led by Professor Daniel Prieto-Alhambra, is using NHS data to determine whether COVID-19 vaccination can protect against developing long COVID (Impact of COVID-19 vaccination on preventing long COVID: a population-based cohort study using linked NHS data, £233,000).

790,790,"How can health professionals accurately diagnose long COVID?
","More targeted treatments for people with long COVID will also come from healthcare professionals knowing what to look for when they diagnose the illness and which factors might make someone more likely to develop it. 

Professor Nishi Chaturvedi from UCL leads the CONVALESCENCE study (Characterisation, determinants, mechanisms and consequences of the long-term effects of Covid-19: providing the evidence base for health care services, £9.6 million). This study aims to define long COVID. 

Researchers from all over the UK, 130 in all, are analysing the health records of 1.2 million people, together with 10 population-based cohort studies which include more than 45,000 participants. This huge analytical endeavour aims to determine if certain medical conditions increase the risk of developing long COVID. So far, researchers have found that 1.2% of young adults (and 4.8% of people in middle age) report symptoms that limit their daily life following COVID-19 infection. Long COVID appears to be associated with increasing age, female sex and pre-existing conditions such as asthma. 

The team will conduct in-depth interviews with at least 80 participants with long COVID to understand their experiences and perspectives. These people are from across the UK and are aged from 20 to 75 years. Some (alongside a control group) will be asked to wear a wristband measuring their exercise ability, breathing and heart rate. They will also undergo non-invasive imaging scans to look for signs of damage to organs such as the heart and lungs.

Ongoing breathlessness after COVID-19 infection can be debilitating. The EXPLAIN project (Hyperpolarised xenon magnetic resonance pulmonary imaging in patients with Long-Covid; £1.9 million) is led by University of Oxford’s Professor Fergus Gleeson. EXPLAIN aims to determine what proportion of patients with long COVID and breathlessness have damaged lungs, and how long it takes them to recover. 

Gleeson is using MRI scans to trace inhaled xenon gas moving into and out of the lungs. The 15-minute scan might provide a more accurate measure of lung function than current NHS tests. Early results suggest that xenon MRI scans can identify abnormalities in the lungs of long COVID patients with breathlessness, even when all other tests are normal.

Researchers also want to determine how long COVID might affect the brain. Some studies suggest more than three-quarters of people with the illness report problems with memory, attention and ‘brain fog’. Dr Dennis Chan’s’s CICERO study (Cognitive Impairment in Long Covid: PhEnotyping and RehabilitatiOn, £1.3 million) at UCL is exploring the relationship between brain function and long COVID symptoms, using MRI scanning to identify the brain networks that are affected.

791,791,Do children experience long COVID?,"Children are unlikely to experience severe acute illness if they contract COVID-19, but unfortunately, some go on to develop long COVID.  The CLoCk study (Non-hospitalised Children and young people with Long Covid, £1.9 million) is exploring the prevalence of long COVID in children, and the symptoms most likely to persist weeks after initial infection. It involves collaborators from universities in London, Bristol, Edinburgh and Manchester. It is the world’s largest study of long COVID in children and young people, with 20,000 participants enrolled. Those who have had COVID-19 will be compared to a control group who have never tested positive for the virus. 

Researchers will ask participants if they still have physical or mental health problems at 3, 6, 12 and 24 months after infection. Participants’ parents and carers will be encouraged to help complete the surveys. The researchers hope the data will help doctors diagnose long COVID in young people, establish how common it is, and how long symptoms might persist. 

The CLoCK study was set up in response to conflicting evidence which has suggested that long COVID could affect as few as 1% of children infected with coronavirus; or up to as many as half.  Early findings from the CLoCK’s 3-month follow-up suggest that around one in seven (14%) children and young people who catch SARS-CoV-2 have three or more physical symptoms attributable to the virus 15 weeks later. 

The size of our study allowed us to be much more confident that the prevalence wasn’t going to be as big as was feared, but nor was it as trivial as some research suggested, says Professor Stephenson (who leads the study). It’s not a figment of people’s imagination. Long COVID really exists and should be taken seriously.

792,792,"What are the symptoms?
","The lasting symptoms of SARS-CoV-2 infection reported by people living with long COVID are manifold. The NIHR review in October 2020 characterised these symptoms. It concluded that, since long COVID affects people in such different ways, it may be four different syndromes.  

Researchers at the University of Birmingham are conducting the TLC study (Therapies for Long COVID in non-hospitalised individuals: From symptoms, patient-reported outcomes and immunology to targeted therapies, £2.3 million). This study aims to build a clearer picture of what long COVID is. Its first report, published in the Journal of the Royal Society of Medicine, sheds light on the ten most commonly reported symptoms. These are: fatigue, shortness of breath, muscle pain, cough, headache, joint pain, chest pain, change in sense of smell and/or taste, and diarrhoea. Other common symptoms include cognitive impairment, memory loss, anxiety and sleep disorders. This review also suggests that people who had five or more symptoms of COVID-19 in the first week of infection are significantly more likely to develop long COVID. Further research by this group has developed a comprehensive tool to assess the symptoms of long COVID and their impact on everyday life.

This confirms what patients have been saying from the beginning: long COVID doesn't just affect one part of your body, says TLC co-lead Dr Shamil Haroon. It affects multiple systems. And has multiple effects.

793,793,How common is long COVID?,"The key to better understanding long COVID is knowing how it manifests in people and why some experience long-term health effects following coronavirus infection and others do not. The REACT study, led by Professor Paul Elliott and Professor Helen Ward at Imperial College London, has tracked England’s epidemic since April 2020. Hundreds of thousands of volunteers are using home testing (swab and antibody tests) each month. 

In February 2021, REACT was expanded to investigate long COVID (REACT-LC, £5.4 million) and track any persistent or new symptoms the volunteers experienced. Much published research on long COVID has included only people who were hospitalised or treated at specialist clinics. We now know that even people with mild symptoms can go on to develop long COVID. REACT therefore focuses on people in the community. 

In June 2021, the team examined data from half a million adults and found that one in three who reported having COVID, also reported symptoms that lasted 12 weeks or more. This equates to one in 20 adults in England having long COVID at some point. The study showed that women, older people, people who smoke, are overweight or obese, or who live in deprived areas appear to have a higher risk of developing long COVID.

A population-based study is a really useful resource in terms of exploring the full range of symptoms someone might experience after a positive COVID-19 test, says Professor Helen Ward, Professor of Public Health at Imperial College London and co-lead of REACT-LC. Patients have been critical in defining long COVID. We’re partners with the patients in this research process. 

Around 10,000 people who had a positive COVID result during the study had further tests to look for genetic and other possible biological markers for long COVID. Researchers hope to be able to use this data to find clues for possible causes of the illness. This in turn could point to potential treatments, including medications that are already used for other conditions.

794,794,What is the biological cause of long COVID?,"Why the symptoms of long COVID can persist for months after the initial illness remains a mystery. Before researchers can develop treatments targeted at long COVID, they need to understand its biological causes. The predominant hypotheses are either that people with long COVID never fully clear the virus from their systems; or that the illness results from a dysfunctional immune response, explains Professor David Price, from the School of Medicine, Cardiff University.

Professor Price is planning to investigate whether small fragments of coronavirus persist in the bodies of people with long COVID long after the immune system should have eliminated the virus (Immunologic and virologic determinants of Long Covid, £774,000). At least 200 people with long COVID will be invited for a series of biological tests on their blood, stool, and saliva samples. 

At Imperial College London, Professor Danny Altmann and Professor Rosemary Boyton are also exploring the mechanisms underpinning long COVID (Immune analysis of Long Covid to inform rational choices in diagnostic testing and therapeutics, £574,000). The team are analysing blood samples from people with long COVID who were not hospitalised, and comparing them to people without COVID, and to those who recovered rapidly. The research aims to identify relevant biomarkers which could lead to better diagnostic tests and treatments.

795,795,Do we really need second generation vaccines?,"In light of both Moderna and Pfizer-BioNTech testing additional booster shots of their authorized vaccines, it stands to question whether variant-matched vaccines are necessary. Our own (so far unpublished) work show[s] that repeat boosting can generate antibodies that potently knock out [SARS-CoV-  which is far more antigenically different than variants of [SARS-CoV-, he said on the social media platform. In his view, there is thus enough ground to test the potential of an additional booster dose in creating immunity against emerging SARS-CoV-2 variants, rather than developing second generation vaccines that match these variants. Responding to MNT‘s queries, 

Novavax told us that they did expect that matched, bivalent, or multivalent vaccines against COVID-19 will become necessary in the future. Another company looking at specifically targeting emerging variants are CureVac. With their mRNA vaccine candidate currently in phase 3 clinical trials, CureVac are currently studying how well it will perform against SARS-CoV-2 variants in targeted in vitro studies, Vice President of Communications Thorsten Schüller told MNT. CureVac have teamed up with GSK and the U.K. government to develop second generation COVID-19 vaccines.

Mutations are natural survival strategies of viruses, and SARS-CoV-2 variants are going to continue to occur throughout the world, and their number is likely to increase in the future, Mr. Schüller explained. There will be an enormous need for vaccines in general and particularly for multivalent vaccines. Vaccine developers are clearly taking the threat that new SARS-CoV-2 variants may pose risks seriously. Whether we face a future with variant-matched annual boosters akin to the flu shot remains to be seen. For pharmaceutical companies, a steady demand for vaccines may also spell a guaranteed income.

797,797,"Is it normal to have palpitations or changes to your heart rate after Covid?
","Some people are experiencing heart palpitations or changes to their heart rate as a symptom of long Covid. According to an analysis of several studies involving 48,000 people with long Covid, more than one in 10 of them (11 per cent) experienced heart palpitations. This can feel like your heart is racing, pounding or fluttering, and you may feel this in your chest, neck or throat. While this can feel worrying, it helps to know that heart palpitations are very common (even in people who aren’t recovering from Covid) and are usually harmless. Changes to your heart rate can be caused by many things, such as dehydration, stress or anxiety, exercise, caffeine or new medications. In very few cases they may be caused by an abnormal heart rhythm. In some people with long Covid, heart palpitations may be caused by a problem with their autonomic nervous system (which controls things such as your heart rate, breathing and blood pressure). This condition is called postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome (PoTS). We don’t know for sure how common this is among long Covid sufferers, but it may be a significant proportion of those who get palpitations or dizziness when they stand up.

801,801,What type of chest pain do people get after Covid-19?,"We are still learning more about chest pain following Covid-19, but it seems likely that it can be caused by a variety of things.
Muscle pain or soreness (myalgia): Severe viral infections, including Covid-19, can cause muscle pain or soreness, which can be in a specific area or spread more widely. The affected area feels sore to the touch and is made worse by specific movements such as turning the chest or stretching.

Non-specific chest pain: Non-specific chest pain, which is also called non-cardiac chest pain, can be sharp or dull, and can happen in short bursts or be ongoing. It often doesn’t have a cause that can be found.

802,802,"Why do some people get palpitations, feel lightheaded or faint after Covid?","There is emerging evidence that some people who develop long Covid have similar symptoms to people with a condition known as postural tachycardia syndrome, or postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome (PoTS). This condition can cause dizziness when moving to an upright position and can be triggered by infections. The most common symptoms are feeling lightheaded, palpitations (being aware of your heartbeat) and fatigue. There have been several case reports in medical journals of people who had continuing symptoms following Covid-19 infection, and some were found to have PoTS. PoTs happens because your body's ways of avoiding a drop in blood pressure when you stand up aren't working properly. Normally when you sit up or stand up, gravity makes some of your blood flow downwards, which can cause a fall in blood pressure. Your body responds to prevent a fall in blood pressure by narrowing your blood vessels and slightly increasing your heart rate. But if you have PoTS these automatic changes don’t happen. When you move to an upright position the supply of blood to your heart and brain drops and your heart starts beating faster to compensate.","['graviti', 'tachycardia', 'downward', 'narrow', 'palpit', 'symptom', 'peopl', 'feel', 'blood', 'stand', 'faint', 'move', 'postur', 'automat', 'fall', 'lighthead', 'posit', 'syndrom', 'bodi', 'beat', 'vessel', 'pressur', 'upright', 'heart', 'condit', 'drop', 'happen', 'pot', 'orthostat', 'compens']"
803,803,Is it normal to have back pain after Covid?,"While joint and muscle problems can occur anywhere in the body during or after Covid-19, back problems are among the most common. You may have had back pain at times before getting Covid-19, and if you were less active while you were ill, this could have made joint or muscle problems come back, or get worse. Joint stiffness and muscle weakness is also likely to get worse if you weren’t moving around as much when you were unwell. In the weeks after getting Covid-19, some people have back ache or a feeling or pins and needles. As you continue to recover, many of these symptoms may also improve. You can aim for a balance of rest with as much of your normal daily activity you feel you can do, and also exercise to improve your strength and flexibility, such as stretches or yoga.
